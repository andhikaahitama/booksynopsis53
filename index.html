The premier scholar of globalization studies, Manfred B. Steger, brings together twenty of the "greatest hits" of the field since it emerged in the 1980s, carefully selecting and editing these influential pieces out of a vast repertoire of writing. Manageable in length and price, this "Top 20" collection shows how globalization has evolved and how it serves as a backdrop to the current global economic crisis.<br></p><p><br><strong>Manfred B. Steger</strong> is Professor of Political Science and Senior Advisor on International Education and Globalization to the Dean of Social Sciences at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa. He is also the Research Leader of the Globalization and Culture Program in RMIT University's Global Cities Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia. Dr. Steger is the author or editor of twenty-one books including <em>Globalization: A Very Short Introduction,</em> Third Edition (OUP, 2013).<br><br>"<em>The Global Studies Reader,</em> Second Edition, is a highly convenient one-stop shop for many of the seminal articles in the field. The book's competitive advantages include its reasonable price, convenient size, and the fact that it's been compiled by such a world-renowned expert on the processes and ideologies of globalization."--Roberto E. Campo, <em>The University of North Carolina at Greensboro</em><p></p><br>"I would certainly use <em>The Global Studies Reader.</em> The level of scholarship is second to none. This book provides the in-depth analysis that is essential to exposing undergraduates to contending issues and events in international studies."--Chris Dolan, <em>Lebanon Valley College</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Mathematical Statistics</h2><p>This book emphasizes the theory of mathematical statistics while using applications and precise language to help illustrate points and motivate students. This new edition features exercises throughout each chapter; presents a dual approach to hypothesis testing - basing decisions on statistics and critical regions or P-values; expands coverage of estimation; treats analysis of t x c tables with ordered categories; and discusses robustness for estimation and testing hypotheses.</p><p>A calculus-based introduction to the theory -- and application -- of statistics.</p><h2>Folk Song Sight Singing Book 2</h2><p>An easy book for developing sight-reading skills in this graded series for singers.</p><p>The respected English choral conductor, pedagogue, and composer, William Gillies Whittaker (1876-1944) was well-known as a Bach conductor and scholar, and edited various instrumental works of the 17th and 18th centuries. He was editor of the series of Bach&#39;s cantatas with English texts by C. Sanford Terry, published by Oxford University Press.</p><h2>Poles Apart: Parallel Visions of the Arctic and Antarctic</h2><p>The harsh beauty of the polar regions has long fascinated explorers and armchair adventurers alike. The forbidding terrain and exotic life-forms appeal to our sense of wonder, and while we may think of them as similar, the Arctic and Antarctic are as unlike as Kansas and Kenya. In <i>Poles Apart</i>, Galen Rowell takes us on an exhilarating visual journey to the top and the bottom of the world, using his camera to reveal the fascinating differences in these polar opposites.<br><br>In Part I, Rowell's side-by-side photographs highlight the contrasts between North and South. The photo essays of Part II continue the comparisons, developing such themes as Arctic and Antarctic science, polar bears and penguins, and visits to the North and South Poles. Part III provides detailed information on the story behind each photograph as well as technical data of interest to photographers.<br><br>Galen Rowell is known for choosing subjects that, while beautiful, are unfamiliar to much of his audience. Yet his books enjoy wide appeal because he accurately focuses&#x2014;in images and words&#x2014;on the essential spirit that sets his subjects apart from the rest of the world. So it is with the distant lands and seas of the polar regions, which hold valuable lessons for all of us concerning evolution, geology, history, human endeavor, and the impact of human greed. No other vast areas of the earth remain as pristine, and for Rowell, the Arctic and Antarctic have become metaphors for those intangible elements that define the earth's wild places. In a world fast becoming a theme park of artificial experience, his book is an invitation to understand and appreciate what is real.</p><p>&#34;Galen Rowell has a wonderful combination of qualities (eye, energy, intelligence, sensitivity, courage both physical and moral, and above all, heart. Very seldom have I experienced so clearly defined the connection between the artist and what he sees, feels, and does with the work itself.&#34; (Robert Redford)<b>Galen Rowell</b> (1940-2002) devoted his life to wilderness exploration, photography, and writing, making more than twenty journeys to the polar regions. In 1992 he received a grant from the National Science Foundation to travel around Antarctica with scientists to research this book. Rowell is a recipient of the Ansel Adams Award for his contributions to wilderness photography, and his work has often appeared in <i>Life</i>, <i>National Geographic</i>, and other major publications. Among his eleven previous books are <i>Galen Rowell's Vision: The Art of Adventure Photography</i> (1993) and <i>Mountain Light: In Search of the Dynamic Landscape</i> (1986). He photographed and produced <i>My Tibet</i>, with text by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, for the University of California Press in 1990.</p><h2>Statistics for Epidemiology</h2><p><p>Statistical ideas have been integral to the development of epidemiology and continue to provide the tools needed to interpret epidemiological studies. Although epidemiologists do not need a highly mathematical background in statistical theory to conduct and interpret such studies, they do need more than an encyclopedia of "recipes."</p> <p>Statistics for Epidemiology achieves just the right balance between the two approaches, building an intuitive understanding of the methods most important to practitioners and the skills to use them effectively. It develops the techniques for analyzing simple risk factors and disease data, with step-by-step extensions that include the use of binary regression. It covers the logistic regression model in detail and contrasts it with the Cox model for time-to-incidence data. The author uses a few simple case studies to guide readers from elementary analyses to more complex regression modeling. Following these examples through several chapters makes it easy to compare the interpretations that emerge from varying approaches.</p> <p>Written by one of the top biostatisticians in the field, Statistics for Epidemiology stands apart in its focus on interpretation and in the depth of understanding it provides. It lays the groundwork that all public health professionals, epidemiologists, and biostatisticians need to successfully design, conduct, and analyze epidemiological studies.</p></p><p>&#34;Jewell&#39;s book can certainly be included in any group of useful books on statistics in epidemiology. It actually might be the one with which I would start.&#34; - Technometrics, February 2005, Vol. 47, No. 1 &#34;This is a useful and thought-provoking book written by an expert in the field, providing a very valuable supplement to more introductory texts as well as a guide to more advanced sources.&#34; - Journal of the Royal Statistics Society &#34;Good points of the book are the exercises, comments and further reading at the end of each chapter, the availability of the data sets usedand the extensive discussion of confoundingthis is a good, well-written piece of work.&#34; Pharmaceutical Statistics, 2004 &#39;This book is excellent; a real breakthrough in texts on statistics in epidemiology, especially in its attention to causation and bias&#39;. -Sander Greenland, Department of Epidemiology, UCLA &#34;Using examples, this experienced statistician identifies scientific issues and clearly links them to statistical approaches. Statistical theory and formality are grounded in manageable yet realistic examples. Coverage includes the basics and important topics such as measurement error and causal analysis.

Banned after its initial publication in 1900, its realist narrative counterplays the story of a young woman seduced by the modern city with that of the middle-aged man who enslaves himself with his love for her. This is the only paperback version using the text widely regarded by scholars as Dreiser&#39;s final version.</p><p><i>Sister Carrie</i>, Theodore Dreiser's revolutionary first novel, was published in 1900--sort of. The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored "author's cut" of <i>Sister Carrie</i> that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing.<p> Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by <i>Sister Carrie</i>'s last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i></p>Theodore Dreiser had a hardscrabble youth and the years of newspaper work behind him when he began his first novel, <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the story of a beautiful Midwestern girl who makes it big in New York City. Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.</p><h2>From Boycott to Annihilation: The Economic Struggle of German Jews, 1933-1943 (The Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)</h2><p>The fullest account to date of German Jews&#x2019; struggle for economic survival under the Third Reich.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. 18 illus. 3 tables LC 89-40228Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>The Mechanization of the Mind</h2><p><p>In March 1946, some of the greatest minds of the twentieth century--among them John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Walter Pitts--gathered at the Beekman Hotel in New York City with the aim of constructing a science of mental behavior that would resolve at last the ancient philosophical problem of mind and matter. The legacy of their collaboration is known today as cognitive science. Jean-Pierre Dupuy, one of the principal architects of cognitive science in France, reconstructs the early days of the field here in a provocative and engaging combination of philosophy, science, and historical detective work. He shows us how the ambitious and innovative ideas developed in the wake of that New York meeting prefigured some of the most important developments of late-twentieth-century thought. Many scholars, however, shunned the ideas as crude and resented them for being overpromoted. This rejection, Dupuy reveals, was a tragic mistake and a lost opportunity.</p><p>As Dupuy explains, the founders of cognitive science--or, as they called it, "cybernetics"--drew passion and energy from two convictions: that the mind operates like a machine and that physical laws explain how nature can appear to have meaning. Armed with these convictions, they laid the foundations not only for cognitive science but also artificial intelligence, and foreshadowed the development of chaos theory, complexity theory, and a variety of other major scientific and philosophical breakthroughs. Today, their ideas speak directly to controversies that rage between cognitivists and connectionists, eliminative materialists and Wittgensteinians, functionalists and anti-reductionists. However, despite their genuine achievements, the cyberneticians had too much confidence in the power of their theories and made serious mistakes that led the next generation of thinkers to ignore their work. The development of a scientific theory of mind was thus significantly delayed.</p><p>A profound and beautifully written book, <i>The Mechanization of the Mind</i> brings back to life the intellectual brilliance and excitement that attended the birth of cognitive science more than fifty years ago, and recasts our understanding of the history of the twentieth century thought.</p></p><p><br> <p>"Dupuy, in this brilliant translation by Malcolm DeBevoise . . . [places] cybernetics within a centuries-long perspective of European philosophy which enriches our understanding of the successes and failures of present-day cognitive science."<b>--Michael Arbib, author of <i>Brains, Machines, and Mathematics</i><br> </b><br> </p><br><b>Jean-Pierre Dupuy</b> is Professor of Social and Political Philosophy at the �cole Polytechnique in Paris, where he founded and directs the Applied Epistemology Research Center (CR�A), one of the leading research institutions in France devoted to cognitive and social science. In addition, he holds a professorship at Stanford University and is a researcher in Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information (C.S.L.I.).</p><h2>Around the World in Eighty Days (Macmillan Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Designed to appeal to the book lover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautifully bound pocket-sized gift editions of much loved classic titles.

Utilizing sources from a variety of subject areas including philosophy, psychology, and biology, editor Robert Solomon provides an illuminating look at the "affective" side of psychology and philosophy from the perspective of the world's great thinkers. Part One of the book features five classic readings from Aristotle, the Stoics, Descartes, Spinoza, and Hume. Part Two offers classic and contemporary theories from the social sciences, presenting selections from such thinkers as Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud alongside recent work from Paul Ekman, Catherine Lutz, and others. Part Three presents some of the extensive work on emotion that developed in Europe over the past century. Part Four includes essays representing the discussion of emotions among British and American analytic philosophers. The volume is enhanced by a comprehensive introduction by the editor and a multidisciplinary bibliography. <br> <em>What is an Emotion?</em> is appropriate for any course in which the nature of emotion plays a major role, including philosophy of emotion, philosophy of mind, history of psychology, emotion and motivation, moral psychology, and history and psychology of consciousness courses. The second edition provides much more material on emotions in the sciences and more from recent philosophical theories, encompassing recent shifts in theorizing on three fronts: the wealth of new information on the central nervous system and the brain; new developments in cross-cultural research and anthropology; and the recent emphasis on "cognition" in emotion, both in philosophy and the social sciences. New selections include work by Antonio Damasio, Ronald De Sousa, Paul Ekman, Nico Frijda, Patricia Greenspan, Paul Griffiths, Richard Lazarus, Catherine Lutz, Martha Nussbaum, and Michael Stocker.<br></p><p>Robert C.

David Moody's critically acclaimed three-part biography of Ezra Pound weaves together the illuminating story of his life, his achievements as a poet and a composer, and his one-man crusade for economic justice. The years 1921-1939 were the most productive of Pound's career. In 1920s Paris, he was among the leading figures of the avant-garde and, in that ambience, he composed an opera, made original contributions to the theory of harmony, and wrote the first thirty cantos of his great epic. Moody explores this creativity in fascinating detail, examining the environment that allowed for some of Pound's greatest work. This period also brought Pound's politics firmly into view and Moody is able to shed new light on his sympathy for Mussolini's Fascism, his invoking Confucian China as a model of responsible government, and his abiding commitment to the democratic values of the American Constitution. <br> <br>Pound is revealed as a great poet and a flawed idealist caught up in the turmoil of his darkening time and struggling, sometimes blindly and in error and self-contradiction, to be a force for enlightenment.<br></p><p><br>A.

Step Two <br></b><br>My search for a method of scripting that worked 100% of the time hit a fever pitch. I was bound and determined that, no matter what, I was going to figure out how the hell this scripting worked. I read over 300 books on the Law of Attraction, visualization, positive thinking, New Thought, psychology, writing, and everything in between. I watched videos, I talked to every kind of person from New Age shop clerks to doctors and a priest to try to get to the answer. But, no matter where I turned or where I looked, I kept coming up dry. I kept searching in every possible realm looking for someone else to have the answer. <br><br>Someone has to know, I told myself. But, no matter what I did, no one really had the solution to making scripting work 100% of the time. At that moment in my life, I would have been happy if someone could point me to a place where it worked 65% of the time. <br><br>Then, I was with some like-minded friends one night who were also studying New Thought. As I was lamenting to them about my quest for the right person, book, or whatever to give me the answer, my friend looked at me with a stare I will never forget and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s you, Royce.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; I asked, not quite understanding what she meant.<br><br>&#x201c;It has to be you. You keep searching and looking for someone else to have the answer to making scripting work, yet you always turn up dry. It&#x2019;s you. You&#x2019;re the one who has to find the answer. No one else is going to find it. You&#x2019;ve been studying manifesting since you were a kid. You probably already know the answer. Why don&#x2019;t you go back and look at your notebooks or something?&#x201d;<br><br>A light bulb went off in my head. She was right, I had years of notebooks I had used for my manifesting work, but I knew that wasn&#x2019;t where the answer was. Not in those notebooks full of lists and long-form scripts. Instead, I got up and ran to my room. I looked at my bedside dresser, and there it was: my journal. <br><br>I had only been seriously keeping a journal for a little over a year, and I was sure that maybe if I read through some entries from when scripting worked, I would find the key. I thought that maybe if I could look at what else I did besides scripting on the days where the scripting worked, I would find something. I started reading. And then it hit me: I was holding the answer in my hand. I flipped through my journal entries. The reason I had even decided to keep the journals was because I wanted a record of everything I did each day. I also kept them to have a record of what manifesting work I had done. But the answer wasn&#x2019;t in the journal entries. <br><br><b>The answer was the journal itself.</b> <br><br>&#x201c;Holy shit.&#x201d; I stared at my journal in disbelief. I realized something so powerful, so life-changing, and so simple, it almost made me fall on the floor.<br><br>&#x201c;My journal entries need to match my script! My journal entries need to match!&#x201d; <br><br>Suddenly, it was like I downloaded the answer. I just knew the scripting key. I told my friends that scripting would never work 100% of the time if we were always &#x201c;scripting&#x201d; weeks, months, or years in the future--or not even in a set time period at all! That is the literal opposite of scripting&#x2019;s power. It could be a tool that works daily--with a huge margin of success. But the whole concept needed to be turned upside down, shaken out, and put back together. I knew I finally had the formula to making scripting work every day, every time. <br><br>The next morning, I woke up early and decided to try an experiment. The day before, a few hours before I had my &#x201c;ah ha!&#x201d; moment with scripting, I had an audition for a small role on the Nickelodeon sitcom <i>Zoey 101</i>. I woke up first thing in the morning around 9AM and did my Daily Want List and Daily Belief List. Then, I did something I had never done before in my manifesting notebook. I flipped the page and wrote &#x201c;script&#x201d; at the top with the day&#x2019;s date to the left. It was May 24th, 2007. I then proceeded to write a one page script as if I was writing in my journal at the end of the night before bed. <br><br>I wrote in all of the little details I already knew were happening that day, like scene-study practice with my acting class partner. BUT, I also added in what I wanted to happen. I scripted in my manager calling me to tell me I booked the role on <i>Zoey 101</i>. I also added in that I got a screen test for a pilot I had worked on that had been picked up and they were doing some late re-casting on, as well as some other details.<br><br>. . . The day went on pretty much as normal, except I didn&#x2019;t get a call from my manager or agent about booking the job or getting a screen test. I didn&#x2019;t let it phase me. <br><br>A few days went by, and then something magical happened. I didn&#x2019;t even realize it until I was writing in my real journal the night of May 30th, 2007, just six days after my little scripting experiment started. I stared at my real journal in disbelief for a moment, then ran to get my morning manifesting notebook and flipped back a few pages to my entry from the first day of the experiment. I was blown away. The morning scripted entry from May 24th matched my real journal entry from May 30th almost to the letter! I was so excited I could barely contain myself.</p><h2>Origins of the State and Civilization: The Process of Cultural Evolution</h2><p>How did civilized life begin? How did government arise? These questions have intrigued philosophers and historians since ancient times. In this volume, Elman R. Service, an anthropologist widely known for his studies of evolution and social organization, uses a unique mix of ethnology, history, and archaeology in exploring the origins and early development of political organization. <br><br>In Part I, 'The Origins of Government,' Service outlines the basic patterns of power and authority that structure even the most primitive societies, showing how these patterns become elaborated as simple egalitarian societies evolve into more complex hierarchical forms. He also discusses classic theories of government from the Enlightenment through Marx and Engels to the modern social scientist. <br><br>Part II, 'The Modern Primitive States,' illustrates the development of institutionalized government; among the societies discussed are the Zulu and the Ashanti in Africa, the Cherokee in North America, and Hawaii in Oceania. <br><br>Part III, 'The Archaic Civilizations,' looks at the six primary ancient civilizations... in Mesoamerica, Peru, Mesopotamia, Egypg, the Indus River Valley, and China... in light of the historical and ethnographical data.<br><br>We should not expect to find, Service argues, that primitive cultures mirror the basic structures of modern society.

Walsh, M.D., is the director of the Department of Urology at Johns Hopkins Hospital and pioneer of the revolutionary, now-standard operation in which the prostate is removed but potency and continence are preserved. The recipient of numerous awards and honors, he has appeared as an expert consultant on such national programs as Good Morning America, Larry King Live, 20/20, and The MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.Walsh, professor of urology at Johns Hopkins University, and Worthington, a medical writer, offer a thorough guide to one of the most frightening diseases for men. Starting with an explanation of how the prostrate works surprisingly, it's not an essential organ Walsh then discusses why prostate cancer is prevalent in the U.S. and other developed Western countries, but not in Asia. He also detail the reasons men develop prostate cancer, including age, race, family history and diet. The book describes a variety of symptoms, some of which indicate ailments other than cancer, and what steps should be taken to get a proper diagnosis. Complete with diagrams and charts detailing the results of biopsy, the book provides an exceptionally complete (albeit worrisome, for squeamish readers) overview of the disease. Many of these details not taking aspirin prior to a biopsy, taking antibiotics ahead of time should obviously be included in the information doctors routinely provide to patients, but given the state of today's medical system, having such information available in this ready guide is useful and reassuring. Similarly comprehensive and easy-to-understand explanations are provided for surgical and other types of treatment, side effects, postsurgical complications and more, as well as a glossary of medical terms, along with a brief resource section. While people shouldn't use this book as a substitute for a medical check-up, it is one of the best all-inclusive books on this subject. All men and their loved ones battling or concerned about prostate cancer should read this book. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Serial Killers: Death and Life in America&#39;s Wound Culture</h2><p>In this provocative cultural study, the serial killer emerges as a central figure in what Mark Seltzer calls &#39;America&#39;s wound culture&#39;. From the traumas displayed by talk show guests and political candidates, to the violent entertainment of Crash or The Alienist, to the latest terrible report of mass murder, we are surrounded by the accident from which we cannot avert our eyes. Bringing depth and shadow to our collective portrait of what a serial killer must be, Mark Seltzer draws upon popular sources, scholarly analyses, and the language of psychoanalysis to explore the genesis of this uniquely modern phenomenon. Revealed is a fascination with machines and technological reproduction, with the singular and the mass, with definitions of self, other, and intimacy. What emerges is a disturbing picture of how contemporary culture is haunted by technology and the instability of identity.</p><p>Mark Seltzer is a professor of English at Cornell University who has previously explored, in his book <i>Bodies and Machines</i>, the notion of a technological society as one in which processes of "registration, recording, and reproduction" break down distinctions between individual and mass, private and public. In <i>Serial Killers</i>, he argues that this "machine culture" constitutes a "pathological public sphere" that sets up the serial killer as an icon of our "wound culture"--a public not only enthralled by, but addicted to, murder and mayhem. The <i>Washington Post</i> writes of this book: "Drawing with equal dexterity on sources ranging from gay pulp novelist Dennis Cooper to French philosopher Jacques Lacan, Seltzer sees the serial killer as a sort of performance artist around whom we gather in an unhealthy attempt to exorcise our own demons." <p> Also recommended: <i>Of Men and Monsters: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Construction of the Serial Killer</i> by Richard Tithecott</p>Mark Seltzer is Professor of English at Cornell University.</p><h2>Foundations for Microwave Engineering (MCGRAW HILL SERIES IN ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING)</h2><p>This text covers both passive and active microwave circuits. The text provides detailed coverage of microwave tubes, solid state microwave amplifier design using scattering matrices, parametric amplifiers, and solid state oscillators and mixers. The author emphasizes modern applications of microstrip and other planar transmission lines for the realization of passive and active circuits. There is a systematic design strategy developed for microwave amplifiers that allows input and output voltage standing wave ratios, low noise, optimum gain and stability to be taken into account. The concept of impedance mismatch invariance is introduced to aid the design of multi-state amplifiers using unstable devices. This traditionally difficult topic is simplified by the design methods introduced in the text.</p><p>Microwave Engineering / Foundations for Microwave Engineering Second Edition A Classic Reissue in the IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory Donald G.

It devotes an entire chapter to fundamental microwave tubes, as well as other chapters on periodic structures, microwave filters, small signal solid-state microwave amplifier and oscillator design, and negative resistance devices and circuits. Completely updated in 1992, it is being reissued by the IEEE Press in response to requests from our many members, who found it an invaluable textbook and an enduring reference for practicing microwave engineers.</p> <p><b>About the IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory</b></p> <p>The IEEE Press <b>Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory</b> offers outstanding coverage of the field. It consists of new titles of contemporary interest, as well as reissues and revisions of recognized classics by established authors and researchers. The series emphasizes works of long-term archival significance in electromagnetic waves and applications. Designed specifically for graduate students, researchers and practicing engineers, the series provides affordable volumes that explore and explain electromagnetic waves beyond the undergraduate level.</p>Robert E. Collin is the author or coauthor of more than 150 technical papers and five books on electromagnetic theory and applications. His classic text, Field Theory of Guided Waves, is also a volume in the series. Professor Collin has had a long and distinguished academic career at Case Western Reserve University. In addition to his professional duties, he has served as chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering and as interim dean of engineering. Professor Collin is a life fellow of the IEEE and a member of the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society and the Antennas and Propagation Society (APS). He is a member of U.S. Commission B of URSI and a member of the Geophysical Society. Other honors include the Diekman Award from Case Western Reserve University for distinguished graduate teaching , the IEEE APS Distinguished Career Award (1992), the IEEE Schelkunoff Prize Paper Award (1992), the IEEE Electromagnetics Award (1998), and an IEEE Third Millennium Medal in 2000.

He is perhaps best known for his statement, "<em>Cogito, ergo sum,</em>" the cornerstone of his metaphysics. Descartes did not intend the metaphysics to stand apart from his scientific work, which included important investigations into physics, mathematics, and optics. In this book, Sorell shows that Descarates was, above all, an advocate and practitioner of the new mathematical approach to physics, and that he developed his philosophies to support his discoveries in the sciences.</p><p><br><strong>About the Author:</strong> Tom Sorell is Lecturer in Philosophy at the Open University. His books include <em>Knowledge</em> and <em>Descartes</em>, both published by the Open University Press.<br>Once in a while, a publication comes along that on first sight seems oddly out of place but on second viewing is admirably suited to its purpose. This little series of biographical summaries of the thoughts of 24 Western philosophers from Democritus to Derrida is admirable not only for its reasonable price but even more for the intelligence and clarity of the writing. Each volume has been prepared by an expert in the subject, and the result is a series of well-drawn and exceptionally useful pocket-size (4.5 x 7 inches) sketches of major figures in the history of Western thought. The level is such that no special background in philosophy is required to understand the concepts discussed. Each volume also contains a short bibliography, some of which refer to electronic journals or web sites. Most of the individuals chosen for the series come as no surprise, e.g., Descartes, Hegel, Kant, Nietzsche, Locke, Hume, Plato, and Socrates. But there are a few unexpected choices, like Alan Turing and Karl PopperAalthough on further consideration, they make more sense. Turing's influence on mathematics and on the development of computers has long been recognized, but his 1936 paper "On Compatible Numbers," which appeared in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1936-37, influenced studies in the philosophy of mind. Popper's development of the concept of "historicism" in such works as The Open Society and Its Enemies and The Poverty of Historicism significantly influenced 20th-century political thought. Ultimately, this set should be in every academic and public library as well as many school libraries.ATerry C. Skeats, Bishop's Univ.

A theology taking its cue from the parables finds that the genres most closely associated with it are the poem, the novel and the autobiography. These become the prime resources for the theologian who tries to show how insight occurs through language, how one comes to this moment of belief, and how one works it out in one&#39;s own life. The author&#39;s discussion of important works such as J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s The Lord of the Rings, The Violent Bear it Away by Flannery O&#39;Connor, the science fiction of C. S. Lewis and the fantasies of Charles Williams remains as fresh, vital and accessible as it seemed when her book was first published over twenty-five years ago.</p><p>Sallie McFague is Professor of Theology at Vanderbilt University.&#34;Everyone interested in theology will be stimulated by Sallie McFague&#39;s mediating theological position and the form of thinking and discourse she espouses. Those interested in the intercourse between theology and literature will be stimulated by the way she links the two and the perceptive way she handles her literary examples. Biblical scholars will undoubtedly note her primacy of the parables as the central corpus of the biblical records. Preachers of the church will be strengthened by the concern McFague has for the Christian community and the importance of the word through the words of the preachers. With this variety of concerns, Speaking in Parables will have a deservedly wide reading and, perhaps even more important, wide discussion.&#34;</p><h2>Play Matters (Playful Thinking)</h2><p><p><b>Why play is a productive, expressive way of being, a form of understanding, and a fundamental part of our well-being.</b></p><p>What do we think about when we think about play? A pastime? Games? Childish activities? The opposite of work? Think again: If we are happy and well rested, we may approach even our daily tasks in a playful way, taking the attitude of play without the activity of play. So what, then, is play? In <i>Play Matters</i>, Miguel Sicart argues that to play is to be in the world; playing is a form of understanding what surrounds us and a way of engaging with others. Play goes beyond games; it is a mode of being human.</p><p>We play games, but we also play <i>with</i> toys, <i>on</i> playgrounds, <i>with</i> technologies and design. Sicart proposes a theory of play that doesn't derive from a particular object or activity but is a portable tool for being&#x2015;not tied to objects but brought by people to the complex interactions that form their daily lives. It is not separated from reality; it is part of it. It is pleasurable, but not necessarily fun. Play can be dangerous, addictive, and destructive.</p><p>Along the way, Sicart considers playfulness, the capacity to use play outside the context of play; toys, the materialization of play&#x2015;instruments but also play pals; playgrounds, play spaces that enable all kinds of play; beauty, the aesthetics of play through action; political play&#x2015;from Maradona's goal against England in the 1986 World Cup to the hactivist activities of Anonymous; the political, aesthetic, and moral activity of game design; and why play and computers get along so well.</p></p><p>Miguel Sicart is Associate Professor at the Center for Computer Game Research at IT University Copenhagen. He is the author of <i>The Ethics of Computer Games</i> and <i>Beyond Choices: The Design of Ethical Gameplay</i>, both published by the MIT Press.<p><i>Play Matters</i> opens a door into our increasingly playful world. It frames the world of play and playfulness just enough to create a coherent image of these fundamental forces, without spoiling the fun. It opens a way into this world, inviting the reader to engage, creatively and intelligently, in the design of an even more playful future.</p>&#x2015;<b>Bernard De Koven</b>, author of <i>The Well-Played Game</i> and <i>A Playful Path</i><br><br><p>Play is undoubtedly the most important part of any creative process; in fact it <i>is</i> the creative process. Miguel Sicart shows time and time again why play is something that must be taken seriously, why it leads to better, more beautiful, more considered work, and ultimately why play does indeed matter.</p>&#x2015;<b>Brendan Dawes</b>, designer, brendandawes.com<br><br><p>In <i>Play Matters</i>, Sicart shares with us a fascinating toy chest full of concepts, ideas, and observations on the most elusive subject in game studies.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gonzalo Frasca</b>, ORT University Uruguay</p><h2>Parsing Guide to the Greek NT</h2><p>Verse by verse, Nathan E.

Stewart and the Civil War in the West</h2><p>As one of the few higher-ranking officers in the Army of Tennessee to avoid controversy, General Alexander P. Stewart (1821&#x2013;1908) was an outstanding, but not outrageous, leader. In this masterful biography, Sam Davis Elliott traces the life of this undeservedly obscure general, from his early years at West Point through his involvement in nearly all of the battles fought by the Army of Tennessee to his postwar career as an educator and Civil War park commissioner. More than the story of one man, <i>Soldier of Tennessee</i> poignantly conveys the triumphs and failures of the Confederate effort in the West and a divided nation&#x2019;s efforts at reconciliation.</p><p>Sam Davis Elliott is the author an attorney in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and the editor of <i>Doctor Quintard, Chaplain C.S.A. and Second Bishop of Tennessee: The Memoir and Civil War Diary of Charles Todd Quintard.</i>Elliott chronicles a distinguished yet unsung military career, adding usefully to knowledge of the Civil War in the West. A graduate of West Point, Alexander P. Stewart (1821^-1908) spent most of his civilian career as a professional educator. In the war, he went with his native Tennessee and became one of the Confederacy's highest ranking officers, rising from major of artillery to lieutenant general as the last field commander of the Army of Tennessee. His career is scantily documented (e.g., no physical description of him survives), yet he appears to have been a sound tactician, taken good care of his men, and avoided the political backbiting that disfigured the careers of so many other western Confederates. After the war, he returned to teaching as a professor at Ole Miss. Resigning in 1886, he later completed his public career by establishing the Chickamauga Battlefield Park for the National Park Service. A straightforward and useful biography of a straightforward and useful man. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Hatfield Photographic Lunar Atlas</h2><p>Long regarded as the finest photographic lunar atlas available, The Hatfield Lunar Atlas is a model of accuracy and clarity.

It answers this question by providing cost-management tools and techniques needed to support an organization's competitiveness, improve its performance, and help the organization accomplish its strategy. The text is written to help students understand the broader role of cost accounting in helping an organization succeed - and not just the measurement of costs. While the text does include coverage of traditional costing topics (e.g., job-order costing, process costing, service-department cost allocations, and accounting for joint and by-products), its primary strength is the linkage of these topics, as well as more contemporary topics, to an organization's strategy. And with Connect, an easy-to-use homework and learning management solution that embeds learning science and award-winning adaptive tools to improve student outcomes, instructors receive a course solution that includes high quality content and assessment paired with assignments that help students build the skills they need to succeed.<br><br><b>New Co-author: Steven D.

Examining egoism, natural law, utilitarianism, respect for persons, and virtue ethics, this text encourages you to break down ethical deliberations into four classes of concerns: factual, conceptual, application, and moral. the book&#39;s driving claim is that &#34;common morality,&#34; or the stock of moral ideas that most people in our culture share, cannot be captured in a single moral theory, but that each of these theories highlights an important aspect of common morality.</p><p>Charles Edwin Harris, Jr. is Professor of Philosophy at Texas A&amp;M University.

What appear to be solid, fixed objects in the distant sky are actually turbulent spheres of glowing gas fueled by intense nuclear reactions that create all of the heavier elements and eject them into space. With the exception of hydrogen and helium, the atoms that make up the planets and moons, the Earth, and all forms of life, including ourselves, originated from a dying star somewhere in the vastness of the cosmos.<br>In this elegantly written and illustrated volume from the Scientific American Library, James B. Kaler explores the nature of stars, describing our current knowledge of their origin, variety, distribution, composition, and distinctive histories. Dr. Kaler demonstrates that stars are the key to our comprehension of how the Universe evolved - that the development, death, and birth of stars is intimately associated with our own origins and continued existence.<br>From the calculations of Eratosthenes and Aristarchus to recent estimates of galactic motion and theories about dark matter, Stars charts the development of the science of astronomy. The first half of the book moves from earliest myths and folklore to the initial attempts at sky mapping and measurement; from the revolutionary discoveries of Copernicus, Galileo, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, and Newton, to Hubble's constant of universal expansion and other theoretical milestones; from rudimentary seventeenth-century instrumentation to the massive reflectors, radio telescopes, and satellite observations that continue to expand our knowledge of the heavens.<br>The centerpiece of Stars is, appropriately, its chapter on the Sun. This vivid characterization of the star that sustains life on Earth serves as a starting point for Dr. Kaler's chronicle of the stellar life cycle - a series of chapters that concludes the narrative by describing the predictable development of lower-mass stars like the Sun and the evolution of high-mass stars, whose spectacular deaths generate supernovae, pulsars, neutron stars, and the enigmatic black holes.</p><p></p><h2>Inside Job: The Looting of America&#39;s Savings and Loans</h2><p>Outlines the reasons for the crisis in the savings and loan industry and discusses what deregulation could mean for the rest of the banking industry</p><p>Bound to be controversial, this impressive expose by three journalists charges that the S &amp; L industry was taken over by a national network of Mafiosi, corrupt thrift officers, appraisers, auditors and arms- and drug-dealers laundering money, all of whom exploited opportunities provided by the 1982 deregulation. Fortified with unlimited broker deposits, the network plundered hundreds of federally insured thrifts. The authors discount the role of high oil prices, the Sunbelt recession and other factors as catalysts in the S &amp; L disaster. Excepting Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman Erwin Gray, who fought to limit deposit brokerage, Pizzo, Fricker and Muolo accuse the Justice Department, the courts and other federal and state agencies for ignoring or covering up four years of fraud. They also maintain that the guilty have not been punished and little of the loot has been recovered out of official fear of revelation. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Three investigative reporters trace what has happened to the savings-and-loan industry since President Reagan signed into law the Garn-St. Germain bill which deregulated the way thrift institutions can invest money in order to better compete with financial firms that offered more attractive alternatives to savings-and-loan depositors. Some of the results involved shoddy investments that ruined banks and put the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation in deep financial trouble. The authors chronicle some of the more serious cases that involved illegal schemes, organized crime, greedy bank officials, and scandal. Like a good mystery, this is hard to put down, and if the reader has trouble with the jargon, there is a good glossary. A very timely and popular item.<br><i>- Steven J.

Drawing from personal interviews with many of the participants, from unpublished letters, and from rare sound recordings, Daniel Kane brings together for the first time the people, political events, and poetic roots that coalesced into a highly influential community. From the poetry-reading venues of the early sixties, such as those at the Les Deux M�gots and Le Metro coffeehouses to The Poetry Project at St. Mark's Church, a vital forum for poets to this day, Kane traces the history of this literary renaissance, showing how it was born from a culture of publicly performed poetry. The Lower East Side in the sixties proved foundational in American verse culture, a defining era for the artistic and political avant-garde.<br><br>The voices and works of John Ashbery, Amiri Baraka, Charles Bernstein, Bill Berkson, Ted Berrigan, Kenneth Koch, Bernadette Mayer, Ron Padgett, Denise Levertov, Paul Blackburn, Frank O'Hara, and many others enliven these pages, and the thirty five-track CD includes recordings of several of the poets reading from their work in the sixties and seventies. The Lower East Side's cafes, coffeehouses, and salons brought together poets of various aesthetic sensibilities, including writers associated with the so-called New York School, Beats, Black Mountain, Deep Image, San Francisco Renaissance, Umbra, and others. Kane shows that the significance for literary history of this loosely defined community of poets and artists lies in part in its reclaiming an orally centered poetic tradition, adapted specifically to open up the possibilities for an aesthetically daring, playful poetics and a politics of joy and resistance.</p><p>"The literary scene of the Lower East Side was explosive--politically, artistically, and socially. In <i>All Poets Welcome</i> Daniel Kane captures the excitement and vitality of this foundational moment in American poetry. This book is a breakthrough examination of a period that will be rich ground for many studies to come." Peter Gizzi, author of <i>Artificial Heart</i><br><br>"<i>All Poets Welcome</i> opens a door to previously undocumented landscapes of New York City the history, aesthetics, and deep gossip bubbling out of the Lower East Side&#x2019;s poetry community during the 1960s and beyond.

This study of one of the most innovative practitioners of the Beaux-Arts movement in America covers Flagg's early training and Beaux-Arts works, his town and country houses, his commercial and utilitarian buildings, the Singer Tower (which established a new height record while setting a precedent for New York City skyscraper restrictions in scale and density), urban housing reform, and his small houses of modular design.<br> <br> Flagg, the author notes, combined French nineteenth century aesthetics and the principles of academic classicism with American structural technology to create significant buildings during the Progressive Era from 1890 to 1917. His contributions to zoning and height regulations were essential to New York's first laws governing this aspect of the city's architecture. A confirmed individualist, Flagg produced highly original writings and ingenious inventions for construction techniques in low-cost housing and railroad cars.<br> <br> Flagg's adaptation of classicism and his concern for urban contextualism make this study of his work particularly timely.

Each chapter enriches the reader's journey with items such as Sidebars that explore issues in greater depth, Behind-theScenes anecdotes relating various (mis-) adventures of creative artists, Plot Summaries, and focused examinations of a wide range of theater songs. Musical and theatrical vocabulary terms are introduced throughout the text, allowing readers to speak knowledgeably about both the visual and aural aspects of the stage experience. Armed with these perceptions, readers will be posed for greater enjoyment of musical theater's rich legacy, from <i>Don Giovanni to Rent,</i> as well as for increased appreciation of drama and music as independent yet complementary arts. </p><strong>Alyson McLamore</strong> is Professor of Music History&nbsp;at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, where she has been recognized with the university's Distinguished Teaching Award.</p><h2>The Cloud of Unknowing (Element Classics of World Spirituality Editions,)</h2><p>This is Evelyn Underhill&#39;s translation of the medieval spiritual guidebook called The Cloud of Unknowing, written by an anonymous English monk.

Journalists and commentators regularly speculate that the region's turmoil may stem from the psychological momentum of its cultural traditions or of a "tribal" or "fatalistic" mentality. Yet few studies of the region's cultural psychology have provided a critical synthesis of psychological research on Middle Eastern societies.<br><br>Drawing on autobiographies, literary works, ethnographic accounts, and life-history interviews, <em>The Middle East: A Cultural Psychology</em>, offers the first comprehensive summary of psychological writings on the region, reviewing works by psychologists, anthropologists, and sociologists that have been written in English, Arabic, and French. Rejecting stereotypical descriptions of the "Arab mind" or "Muslim mentality,' Gary Gregg adopts a life-span- development framework, examining influences on development in infancy, early childhood, late childhood, and adolescence as well as on identity formation in early and mature adulthood. He views patterns of development in the context of recent work in cultural psychology, and compares Middle Eastern patterns less with Western middle class norms than with those described for the region's neighbors: Hindu India, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Mediterranean shore of Europe. The research presented in this volume overwhelmingly suggests that the region's strife stems much less from a stubborn adherence to tradition and resistance to modernity than from widespread frustration with broken promises of modernization--with the slow and halting pace of economic progress and democratization.<br><br>A sophisticated account of the Middle East's cultural psychology, <em>The Middle East</em> provides students, researchers, policy-makers, and all those interested in the culture and psychology of the region with invaluable insight into the lives, families, and social relationships of Middle Easterners as they struggle to reconcile the lure of Westernized life-styles with traditional values.<br></p><p><br>After receiving a Ph.D. in personality psychology from the University of Michigan, <strong>Gary Gregg</strong> spent five years in southern Morocco, conducting ethnographic research on the partly nomadic Imeghrane confederation in the High Atlas-Dades Valley region, and then a Fulbright- and NSF-sponsored study of identity development among young adults.

What we really need is a dictionary that helps us with the tough words, like <em>elucubrate</em>, or <em>demesne</em>, or <em>cynosure</em>. True, a standard dictionary can bail us out when we run across a tough word at home or in a library. But we often read elsewhere--in a doctor's waiting room or on a plane, or while on vacation. What do we do then? <br> <em>The Oxford Dictionary of Difficult Words</em> is designed to meet this need. A portable, pocket-sized reference, it features more than 10,000 entries that focus exclusively on words that, while outside most people's working vocabulary, are often encountered in literature, in technical writings (such as computing or medical terminology), and in such diverse subject areas as law, philosophy, and art. Entries contain pronunciations, parts of speech, concise definitions, example sentences showing the word used in context, and etymologies when a word's history may shed light on its meaning. Special attention is given to easily confused or closely related words (such as <em>efficacious, effective, effectual</em>, and <em>efficient</em>, or <em>cynical, sarcastic, sardonic</em>, and <em>ironic</em>). Usage notes are provided to ensure that readers know how to integrate these words into their vocabularies for more precision and power in speech and writing. <br> Produced by a team of experienced lexicographers, drawing on Oxford's exclusive 200-million-word database of contemporary English, this handy volume helps us with the words that lie just outside our vocabulary, words we just won't find in other pocket dictionaries.</p><p><br><strong>Archie Hobson</strong> also edited <em>The Oxford Essential Geographical Dictionary</em> (published in 1999 by Berkley Books) and the geographical portion of <em>The Oxford Dictionary of People and Places</em> as well as <em>The Cambridge Gazetteer of the United States and Canada</em>.<br>"Entries are enhanced by sentences and phrases that illustrate the word used in context and a section listing derivatives of the word."--Choice "This work conveniently pulls together more than 10,000 "difficult" words in a readily accessible dictionary."--American Reference Book Annual<br>2002<br><br>"From explanations of closely related, often-confused words to usage notes, The Oxford Dictionary of Difficult Words is packed with important guidelines."--Bookwatch</p><h2>The Art of Interactive Design: A Euphonious and Illuminating Guide to Building Successful Software</h2><p>An understanding of what makes things interactive is key to the successful creation of websites, computer games, and software.

Criticism and Theory. Political Science. An infinite series of bifurcations: this is how we can tell the story of our life, of our loves, but also the history of revolts, defeats and restorations of order. At any given moment different paths open up in front of us, and we are continually presented with the alternative of going here or going there. Then we decide, we cut out from a set of infinite possibilities and choose a single path. But do we really choose? Is it really a question of a choice, when we go here rather than there? Is it really a choice, when masses go to shopping centers, when revolutions are transformed into massacres, when nations enter into war? It is not we who decide but the concatenations: machines for the liberation of desires and mechanisms of control over the imaginary. The fundamental bifurcation is always this one: between machines for liberating desire and mechanisms of control over the imaginary.

The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of antisemitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins. <br><br>The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov, alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next eighteen years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym Sirin and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925 he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri. <br><br>Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. In his afterword to <b>Lolita</b> he claimed: "My private tragedy, which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English, devoid of any of those apparatuses--the baffling mirror, the black velvet backdrop, the implied associations and traditions--which the native illusionist, frac-tails flying, can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own way." [p. 317] Yet Nabokov's American period saw the creation of what are arguably his greatest works, <b>Bend Sinister</b> (1947), <b>Lolita</b> (1955), <b>Pnin</b> (1957), and <b>Pale Fire</b> (1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Russian</p><h2>Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design)</h2><p><p>The most exciting development in parallel computer architecture is the convergence of traditionally disparate approaches on a common machine structure. This book explains the forces behind this convergence of shared-memory, message-passing, data parallel, and data-driven computing architectures. It then examines the design issues that are critical to all parallel architecture across the full range of modern design, covering data access, communication performance, coordination of cooperative work, and correct implementation of useful semantics. It not only describes the hardware and software techniques for addressing each of these issues but also explores how these techniques interact in the same system.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.John Keats was born in October 1795, son of the manager of a livery stable in Moorfields. His father died in 1804 and his mother, of tuberculosis, in 1810. By then he had received a good education at John Clarke&#x2019;s Enfield private school. In 1811 he was apprenticed to a surgeon, completing his professional training at Guy&#x2019;s Hospital in 1816. His decision to commit himself to poetry rather than a medical career was a courageous one, based more on a challenge to himself than any actual achievement. <p>His genius was recognized and encouraged by early Mends like Charles Cowden Clarke and J. H. Reynolds, and in October 1816 he met Leigh Hunt, whose Examiner had already published Keats&#x2019;s first poem. Only seven months later Poems (1817) appeared. Despite the high hopes of the Hunt circle, it was a failure. By the time Endymion was published in 1818 Keats&#x2019;s name had been identified with Hunt&#x2019;s &#x2018;Cockney School&#x2019;, and the Tory <b>Blackwood&#x2019;s Magazine</b> delivered a violent attack on Keats as a lower-class vulgarian, with no right to aspire to &#x2018;poetry&#x2019;.</p> <p>But for Keats fame lay not in contemporary literary politics but with posterity. Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, and Wordsworth were his inspiration and challenge. The extraordinary speed with which Keats matured is evident from his letters. In 1818 he had worked on the powerful epic fragment Hyperion, and in 1819 he wrote &#x2018;The Eve of St Agnes&#x2019;, &#x2018;La Belle Dame sans Merci&#x2019;, the major odes, Lamia, and the deeply exploratory Fall of Hyperion. Keats was already unwell when preparing the 1820 volume for the press; by the time it appeared in July he was desperately ill. He died in Rome in 1821. Keats&#x2019;s final volume did receive some contemporary critical recognition, but it was not until the latter part of the nineteenth century that his place in English Romanticism began to be recognized, and not until this century that it became fully recognized.</p></p><h2>Pocket Guide for Huszar&#39;s Basic Dysrhythmias and Acute Coronary Syndromes: Interpretation and Management</h2><p><p>Updated to reflect the 2010 ECC guidelines,&nbsp;<b>Pocket Guide for </b><b>Huszar&#x2019;s Basic Dysrhythmias and Acute Coronary Syndromes, 4th Edition</b>&nbsp;includes ECG components followed by information on how to interpret ECGs to arrive at a diagnosis.</p></p><p></p><h2>Secrets of Self-Healing: Harness Nature&#39;s Power to Heal Common Ailments, Boost Your Vitality,and Achieve Optimum Wellness</h2><p>Identifies natural remedies and alternative therapies that can treat the sources of illness rather than symptoms, in a guide that cites the side effects of traditional medicine while explaining the benefits of Chinese therapies in combination with exercise and a positive emotional life.</p><p>Dr. Maoshing Ni is a thirty-eighth-generation doctor of Chinese medicine.

Neither approach, however, says enough about how children respond to literature in everyday classroom situations. That is the mission of this book. <br><br>It begins by providing a solid foundation in both approaches and then examines multiple ways of developing children's literary interpretation through talk, through culture, class, and gender, as well as through creative modes of expression, including writing, the visual arts, and drama. The result is a balanced resource for teachers who want to deepen their understanding of literature and literary engagement. <br><br>Because of its modest length and price and its ongoing focus on how to increase student engagement with literature, either pre-service or practicing teachers can use this text in children's literature, language arts, or literacy and language courses.</p><p><p><i>this book would be an excellent supplementary text for use in children's literature classes....Each chapter is concise, well organized, and highly readable....This book should be a part of any children's literature instructor's personal professional library.</i><br>&#x2014;<b><i>CHOICE</i></b></p><p><i>If you remember a favorite teacher's story about a magical moment in a child's learning, this book is for you.

Marketa Lazarova was promised to God at birth, destined to live her life in a convent, but she is abducted by one of the neighboring Kozlík clan and discovers her sensual self. Told in shifting perspectives, mixing the archaic with the modern, the elevated with the vulgar, Vancura�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s tale is a compressed epic, less historical novel (the history of his ancestors) than paean to honor, courage, life, carnality, and above all a love that undermines conventional notions of the profane as it shifts to a sacred outside the sanctions of religious dogma. In so doing, he shows the nexus between Crown and Church to subjugate those who prefer to follow their own natures over following imposed laws and precepts. Cinematic in approach to draw the reader into the action, as if it were happening right before one�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s eyes, Marketa Lazarova deserves its place among the classics of interwar modernism, and it was awarded Czechoslovakia�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s State Prize for Literature upon its publication in 1931. Yet the novel has been largely known by Franti<br><br>�ek Vlacil�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s 1967 film adaptation, generally considered one of the greatest achievements of Czech cinema, and unavailable in English until now.</p><p>Novelist, playwright, film director, screenwriter, Vladislav Vancura was born in 1891 in Háj (Silesia) into a family with ancestral roots in the nobility. A founding member of the Czech avant-garde artists group Dev�&#x203a;tsil in 1920, he served as its first chairman and was instrumental in formulating its Poetist program for literature. Vancura's most acclaimed work, Marketa Lazarova, brought him renown as an innovator of the first order and Czechoslovakia�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s State Prize for Literature in 1931. He was arrested on May 12, 1942, by the Gestapo, tortured, and executed on June 1, 1942.Using the narrator to give his clear and not always objective views on what is going on and at times jumping ahead or back in time, we get a fascinating modernist take on a medieval romance (in both senses of the word).<br><br>In a certain sense the novel is a milestone in Van?ura's evolution. Just as scattered rays converge in a single golden strand in the lens of a magnifying glass, in Marketa Lazarov<br><br>[T]his is a remarkable and unusual book, particularly since archaic text is relieved with beautiful writing and contemporary asides. [</p><h2>John Russell Pope</h2><p>John Russell Pope is considered one of America's finest and most important classical architects, and this lavishly illustrated book, long overdue, is the first comprehensive survey of his work. This definitive study, comprised mainly of projects dating from 1910 to 1937, includes the Jefferson Memorial, the National Gallery of Art, Constitution Hall, the National Archives, and the Temple of the Scottish Rite in Washington, D.C.; the Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the Duveen Sculpture Gallery (for the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon) at the British Museum and the Sculpture Hall at the Tate Gallery, both in London; mansions for the Vanderbilts and Marshall Field; and campus plans for the Yale and The Johns Hopkins Universities.<br><br>Steven McLeod Bedford follows the architect's career from his early education through his development as one of the most important figures in classicism, examining every aspect of Pope's architectural output, from his residential and commercial projects to his museums and monuments. Illustrated with archival photographs and Jonathan Wallen's never-before-published new color photography, <i>John Russell Pope: Architect of Empire </i>captures the enduring beauty and significance of this American master's oeuvre.<br></p><p>Despite the contemporary fascination with all things classical that has fueled the recent antimodern movement, this is the first book in more than half a century to explore the career of John Russell Pope (1873-1937). And it is worth the wait as it luxuriously presents the work of the architect of the National Gallery of Art, the Jefferson Memorial, the National Archives, and dozens of other buildings that are now intrinsic to the constructed environment of the U.S. capital. Pope was an architect of such harmony, balance, and effortless grandeur that he might well be ignored by current American neoclassicists, whose ill-conceived gewgaws are put to shame by Pope's stately homes, serene monuments, authoritative collegiate buildings, and regal museums. <p> Architect and historian Steven McLeod Bedford began his solitary, comprehensive, and difficult research for this book during the 1980s, when proponents of the high-minded cultural imperatives of the late 19th century, including the Hudson River School painters, were in vogue. Bedford admirably analyses the strengths and weaknesses of an architect whose most famous buildings "expressed the grandiloquent aspirations of private and public patrons." He also puts Pope's contributions in historical perspective, noting that a 1961 history of American architecture published by the A.I.A. found "no merit in Pope's work." Bedford himself writes with careful objectivity that "Pope seemed to adhere to the precept that a certain set of classical forms and plans existed whose inherent beauty was immutable." </p><p> Bedford writes warmly but dispassionately about buildings that many people love, and some--such as those who listened to Martin Luther King Jr. speak on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, or visited the soaring, softly sky-lit rooms of the National Gallery--have special attachments to. Beauty of this exalted type may no longer be of interest to the architectural cognoscenti, but there is a quality of calm endurance to Pope's buildings that has lasting appeal. In spite of the author's reserve, this is an inspiring, elucidating book, filled with plans, drawings, and color photographs that do some belated justice to Pope's career. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p><b>Steven McLeod Bedford</b> is an architectural historian and a practicing architect in New York.<br><br><b>William L.

As the Georgia backcountry rapidly expanded in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the churches erected on this newly parceled land became the center of community life. These early structures ranged from primitive outbuildings to those with more elaborate designs and were constructed with local, hand-hewn materials to serve the residents who lived nearby. From these rural communities sprang the villages, towns, counties, and cities that informed the way Georgia was organized and governed and that continue to influence the way we live today.</p><p><i>Historic Rural Churches of Georgia</i> presents forty-seven early houses of worship from all areas of the state. Nearly three hundred stunning color photographs capture the simple elegance of these sanctuaries and their surrounding grounds and cemeteries. Of the historic churches that have survived, many are now in various states of distress and neglect and require restoration to ensure that they will continue to stand. This book is a project of the Historic Rural Churches of Georgia organization, whose mission is the preservation of historic rural churches across the state and the documentation of their history since their founding. If proper care is taken, these endangered and important landmarks can continue to represent the state&#x2019;s earliest examples of rural sacred architecture and the communities and traditions they housed.</p></p><p>Some of Georgia&#x2019;s earliest churches offer unique insights into the state&#x2019;s past<b>Sonny Seals (Author) </b><br> SONNY SEALS is a cofounder, with George S.

The author regards music teaching as interrelated with the rest of lived life, and her themes encompass pedagogical skills as well as matters of character, disposition, value, personality, and musicality. She reflects on musicianship and practical aspects of teaching while drawing on a broad base of theory, research, and personal experience. Although grounded in the practical realities of music teaching, Jorgensen urges music teachers to think and act artfully, imaginatively, hopefully, and courageously toward creating a better world.</p></p><p><p>A veteran teacher's practical approach to music education</p>&#34;This book will turn heads and quite likely deepen the thoughts of working musicians who teach.

But until now, the ten days prior to that event have remained in relative obscurity. In <em>Before Antietem</em>, John Michael Priest offers the first book-length, tactical exploration of the Maryland campaign and the Battles of South Mountain, describing the decisive events leading up to the famous battle and elevating them from mere footnote status to a matter of military record. <br> Chronicling Robert E. Lee's turnabout from defensive maneuvres to full scale Confederate invasion into Maryland, Priest demonstrates how this tactical change brought about a series of engagements near Sharpsburg, Maryland that came to be known as "The Battle of South Mountain" in which the Federal and Confederate forces struggled fiercely over Union territory. It was here that George B. McClellan, the new Northern commander, led his Army of the Potomac to its first victory over Lee in a furious action that produced one of the war's few successful bayonet charges. Written from the perspective of the front line combatants (and civilian observers), the book recounts the Confederate invasion and the Federal pursuit into Sharpsburg that set the stage for Antietam. From September 5-15, a total of twenty-five skirmishes and three pitched battles were fought. <br> Priest provides graphic descriptions of the terrible conditions surrounding these events and so thoroughly enters into the common soldier's viewpoint that military history quickly gives way to gritty realism. He vividly shows that, had Robert E. Lee not been bested at the gaps along South Mountain, there would have been no Antietam. Lee's decision to make a stand along Antietam Creek was a point of pride--he had never been "whipped" before and would not return to Virginia defeated. That decision was a fateful one, since the sparring and fighting drove him into an untenable position that became his downfall. Priest's revealing narrative establishes that, at this stage of the Civil War, the Federal cavalry was better equipped and just as well trained as the Confederate cavalry thereby settling a point of debate among historians. <br> Scholars and Civil War buffs alike will applaud the efforts of John Michael Priest in bringing us the means to view those devastating encounters from a true military perspective.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>John Michael Priest</strong> is the author of <em>Antietem: The Soldiers' Battle</em>, and the editor in chief of <em>From New Bern to Fredericksburg: Captain James Wren's Civil War Diary</em>. He is a member of the Civil War Education Association in Winchester, Virginia, and is currently working on two other Civil War book projects.<br>The Battle for South Mountain during the Civil War has always been treated as a prelude to the major Battle of Antietam. Here, Priest, the author of several Civil War books, gives the first full study of the battle and emphasizes its importance. He details the troops' marches, bivouacs, and skirmishes but also gives the reactions of the civilians as they encounter the troops from both sides. The author uses the words and actions of the common soldiers involved, both blue and gray, to describe graphically the conditions preceding the battle, the intense fighting, and the horrrible conditions that were left afterward. Priest has used extensive letters, diaries, military records, and newspaper articles to create a vivid account of a battle for which both sides claimed a victory. Before Antietam sets the stage for the Battle of Antietam. It will make an excellent addition to all Civil War collections.<br><i>- W.

Most of the book, however, is a discussion of how to revolutionize city planning in order to reduce the necessity for cars. Safdie, an architect, uses his own plans for rebuilding portions of cities around the world as the basis for his argument supporting strong land-control laws and restriction of urban sprawl. Instead of suburban shopping malls, Safdie proposes a "linear center," a central area of concentrated development that would serve as a public arena. <p> By restricting land use and concentrating development in city centers instead of on the fringes, Safdie argues that reliance on gas-guzzling automobiles would become a nonissue. His truly is a revolutionary idea, especially for a culture that idealizes suburbia. Although some of the suggestions in <i>The City After the Automobile</i> might seem fanciful, any argument in favor of better planning, less pollution, and less waste of time, money, and resources makes a lot of sense.</p><b>Gerald D.

What characterizes the century that has just come to a close is that, while it underwent the saturation of these three schemata, it failed to introduce a new one. Today, this predicament tends to produce a kind of unknotting of terms, a desperate dis-relation between art and philosophy, together with the pure and simple collapse of what circulated between them: the theme of education. Whence the thesis of which this book is nothing but a series of variations: faced with such a situation of saturation and closure, we must attempt to propose a new schema, a fourth type of knot between philosophy and art. Among these &#x201c;inaesthetic&#x201d; variations, the reader will encounter a sustained debate with contemporary philosophical uses of the poem, bold articulations of the specificity and prospects of theater, cinema, and dance, along with subtle and provocative readings of Fernando Pessoa, St�phane Mallarm�, and Samuel Beckett.</p><p>Alain Badiou holds the Chair of Philosophy at the �cole Normale Sup�riere in Paris.

With insights into the dynamics of trust and mutual expectations, this book proves that before you can deliver a transcendent customer experience (CX), you must first build a superlative employee experience (EX). It's not about perks. It's not about creating a worker's utopia, and it doesn't mean that work must be easy; employees are responsible for managing expectations and meeting the organization's requirements. But by establishing a clear set of expectations and promises--collectively known as "the Contract"--and upholding it consistently, employers can build the essential trust that leads to powerful employee engagement. <br><br>The data are unambiguous: organizations with engaged workforces are more profitable, enjoy greater growth, and win the battle to keep the most talented personnel. <br>Employees who have a fulfilling, rewarding work experience perform better, achieve more, and bring more value to the organization. <i>The Employee Experience</i> teaches you how to leverage the full potential of your people to transform your future: <br><ul> <li>Make the Employee Experience a core part of your strategy</li> <li>Understand employee expectations and bridge the 'Expectation Gap'</li> <li>Establish a rock-solid Contract that breeds trust and confidence</li> <li>Build a culture of support and achievement</li> <li>Turn employee engagement into an exceptional customer experience, profit, and growth</li> </ul> Creating a transformative employee experience is not about stock options or foosball in the break room. It's about respecting the role your people play in representing your brand and building your business. When you give talented people the space to achieve and thrive, they'll give your customers an experience your competitors can't duplicate. <i>The Employee Experience</i> shows you where extraordinary companies start. . . and how to build one.</p><p><p><b>Ever Notice How Companies with the Best Service Also Have the Happiest Employees?

If your employees are having a great experience, so will your customers. </p><p>In <i>The Employee Experience</i>, employee engagement pioneers Tracy Maylett and Matthew Wride reveal the secrets not only to attracting and retaining top talent, but to building a deeply engaged workforce the foundation of organizational success. With deep insights into the dynamics of trust and mutual expectations, this book shows that before you can deliver a transcendent customer experience (CX), you must first build a superlative EX. </p><p>With real-world examples and more than 24 million employee survey responses, Maylett and Wride reveal a clear, consistent pattern among the world's most successful organizations.

Posen demonstrates how the interplay between conventional military operations and nuclear forces could, in conflicts among states armed with both conventional and nuclear weaponry, inadvertently produce pressures for nuclear escalation. Knowledge of these hidden pressures, he believes, may help some future decision maker avoid catastrophe.</p><p>Building a formidable argument that moves with cumulative force, he details the way in which escalation could occur not by mindless accident, or by deliberate preference for nuclear escalation, but rather as a natural accompaniment of land, naval, or air warfare at the conventional level. Posen bases his analysis on an empirical study of the east-west military competition in Europe during the 1980s, using a conceptual framework drawn from international relations theory, organization theory, and strategic theory.</p><p>The lessons of his book, however, go well beyond the east-west competition. Since his observations are relevant to all military competitions between states armed with both conventional and nuclear weaponry, his book speaks to some of the problems that attend the proliferation of nuclear weapons in longstanding regional conflicts. Optimism that small and medium nuclear powers can easily achieve "stable" nuclear balances is, he believes, unwarranted.</p></p><p>Barry R.

Employing physical adventure and violence in a mythopoetic setting drawn largely from his own youthful experience, Cooper evokes the stages of Natty&#39;s initiation as a subtly allegorical medium for instilling permanent values, values he thought should pervade the conduct of the American press and all segments of American society. According to Edmund Wilson, this book--which D. H. Lawrence called &#34;the loveliest and best&#34; of the Leatherstocking series--contains description which &#34;owes its power, like Melville&#39;s description of the Pacific or one of Poe&#39;s pieces on landscape gardening, to an emotional content which has charged the object and transformed it into a symbol. And the action has a reality which we recognize and accept as we read: the reality of a dream full of danger.&#34; -- The Shock of Recognition</p><p>The deadly crack of a long rifle and the piercing cries of Indians on the warpath shatter the serenity of beautiful lake Glimmerglass. Danger has invaded the vast forests of upper New York State as Deerslayer and his loyal Mohican friend Chingachgook attempt the daring rescue of an Indian maiden imprisoned in a Huron camp. Soon they are caught in the crossfire between a cunning enemy and two white bounty hunters who mercilessly kill for profit. The last of the Leatherstocking tales to be written, though first in the chronology of the hero's life, <i>The Deerslayer</i> is James Fenimore Cooper's masterpiece. A fine combination of romance, adventure, and morality; this classic novel of the frontier is an eloquent beginning for Cooper's great wilderness saga--and an unforgettable introduction to the famous character who has said to embody the conscience of America: the noble woodsman Deerslayer.Set during the French and Indian Wars, The Deerslayer vividly captures the essence of both the murderous humanity and the natural beauty that distinguished America's founding. The last of Cooper's famous Leatherstocking Tales, it is first chronologically in the frontier adventures of the backwoods scout Natty Bumppo. Amid a terrain largely inspired by Cooper's own boyhood, Natty's initiation in the moral codes of wilderness society is examined in what is, according to D. H. Lawrence, "the loveliest and best" of the Leatherstocking series. <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the definitive text established by James Franklin Beard and James P.

During his lifetime he made important contributions to many of the major areas of theology: ecclesiology, creation, Christology, discipleship, and ethics. <em>The Oxford Handbook of Dietrich Bonhoeffer</em> surveys, assesses, and presents the field of research and debates of Bonhoeffer and his legacy, as well as of previous Bonhoeffer scholarship. Featuring contributions from leading Bonhoeffer scholars, historians, theologians, and ethicists, many essays draw attention to Bonhoeffer's positive contributions, while several essays also identify limits and problems with his thinking as it stands.<br><br>Divided into five parts, the first section provides a detailed outline of Bonhoeffer's biography and the contexts that gave rise to his theology. The contributors explore the dynamic relationship between Bonhoeffer's life and theology. Section two provides rigorous engagements with and assessments of Bonhoeffer's theology on its own terms. Part three demonstrates how Bonhoeffer's ethical claims and engagements are deeply integrated with theological commitments. The fourth section showcases some of the best work drawing upon Bonhoeffer for engaging contemporary challenges, including feminism, race, public theology in South Africa, and contemporary philosophy. In recent decades, Bonhoeffer's theology has provoked significant critical reflection on social and cultural issues. The essays in this section exemplify how his writings can continue to contribute to such reflection today. The fifth and final section consists of essays on resources for the contemporary study of Bonhoeffer and his theology, including sources and texts, biographies and portraits, and readings and receptions. These essays also address pressing historiographical issues and problems surrounding writing about Bonhoeffer's life and theology. This authoritative collection draws together and assesses the very best of existing research on Bonhoeffer and promotes new avenues for research on Bonhoeffer.<br></p><p><br>Philip G.

G. Jung embarked upon a bold investigation into childhood dreams as remembered by adults to better understand their significance to the lives of the dreamers. Jung presented his findings in a four-year seminar series at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. <i>Children's Dreams</i> marks their first publication in English, and fills a critical gap in Jung's collected works.</p><br><p> Here we witness Jung the clinician more vividly than ever before--and he is witty, impatient, sometimes authoritarian, always wise and intellectually daring, but also a teacher who, though brilliant, could be vulnerable, uncertain, and humbled by life's great mysteries. These seminars represent the most penetrating account of Jung's insights into children's dreams and the psychology of childhood. At the same time they offer the best example of group supervision by Jung, presenting his most detailed and thorough exposition of Jungian dream analysis and providing a picture of how he taught others to interpret dreams. Presented here in an inspired English translation commissioned by the Philemon Foundation, these seminars reveal Jung as an impassioned educator in dialogue with his students and developing the practice of analytical psychology.</p><br><p> An invaluable document of perhaps the most important psychologist of the twentieth century at work, this splendid volume is the fullest representation of Jung's views on the interpretation of children's dreams, and signals a new wave in the publication of Jung's collected works as well as a renaissance in contemporary Jung studies.</p></p><p><p>"This is Jung on dream analysis in more detail than has yet been published. It reveals Jung as an educator in dialogue with his students in a more casual exchange than a formal lecture but one that shows more depth and spontaneity as a give-and-take exchange. A unique feature of the work is that it presents a detailed exposition of the application of archetypal psychology to the dreams of childhood as they have been remembered by adults."<b>--Eugene Taylor, author of <i>William James on Consciousness beyond the Margin</i></b></p><p>"A fascinating offering. It is always a pleasure to watch Jung go to work on a dream, and this book gives an invaluable picture of how he taught others to interpret dreams as well as how he approached them himself. Here, the clinician comes forward, and the dreams and their likely significance for the life of the dreamer remain the focus throughout."<b>--John Beebe, editor of <i>Aspects of the Masculine</i></b></p><b>Maria Meyer-Grass</b> is a Jungian analyst in private practice. <b>Lorenz Jung</b> now deceased, was a grandson of C.

But it was the work of American Robert Hutchings Goddard (1882-1945) and his development of liquid-fueled rockets that first produced a controlled rocket flight. Fascinated by rocketry since boyhood, Goddard designed, built, and launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket in 1926. Ridiculed by the press for suggesting that rockets could be flown to the moon, he continued his experiments, supported partly by the Smithsonian Institution and defended by Charles Lindbergh. This book is comprised of two papers he wrote for the Smithsonian. <br>Among the most significant publications in the history of rockets and jet propulsion, these Smithsonian articles &#x2015; the first published in 1919 and the second in 1936 &#x2015; were issued at a time when little was known about these subjects. Goddard's first paper, "A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes," addressed the theoretical possibility of achieving great ranges by means of well-designed rockets. It also demonstrated that fairly high jet velocities were attainable and described advances in the construction of a solid cartridge magazine-type rocket. The second paper served as a progress report and indicated what had been accomplished through experimentation.<br>Goddard went to to lay the foundations for the development of long-range rockets, missiles, satellites, and spaceflight. In fact, a liquid-fueled rocket constructed on principles he developed landed humans on the moon in 1969. Today, Goddard is widely recognized as the "Father of American Rocketry." According to <i>The New York Times, </i>"This . . . is certainly a book that the historian of rockets cannot ignore."</p><p>&#34;This... is certainly a book that the historian of rockets cannot ignore.&#34;</p><h2>Tanglewood Tales</h2><p>This is a pre-1923 historical reproduction that was curated for quality.

Much of Hawthorne&#39;s writing centers on New England, many works featuring moral allegories with a Puritan inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the Romantic movement and more specifically, Dark romanticism. His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. His published works include novels, short stories and a biography of his college friend Franklin Pierce.Tanglewood Tales For Girls and Boys<br><i>The Wayside</i>INTRODUCTORYA short time ago, I was favored with a flying visit from my young friend Eustace Bright, whom I had not before met with since quitting the breezy mountains of Berkshire. It being the winter vacation at his college, Eustace was allowing himself a little relaxation, in the hope, he told me, of repairing the inroads which severe application to study had made upon his health; and I was happy to conclude, from the excellent physical condition in which I saw him, that the remedy had already been attended with very desirable success. He had now run up from Boston by the noon train, partly impelled by the friendly regard with which he is pleased to honor me, and partly, as I soon found, on a matter of literary business.It delighted me to receive Mr. Bright, for the first time, under a roof, though a very humble one, which I could really call my own. Nor did I fail (as is the custom of landed proprietors all about the world) to parade the poor fellow up and down over my half a dozen acres; secretly rejoicing, nevertheless, that the disarray of the inclement season, and particularly the six inches of snow then upon theground, prevented him from observing the ragged neglect of soil and shrubbery into which the place has lapsed. It was idle, however, to imagine that an airy guest from Monument Mountain, Bald-Summit, and old Graylock, shaggy with primeval forests, could see anything to admire in my poor little hill-side, with its growth of frail and insect-eaten locust-trees. Eustace very frankly called the view from my hill-top tame; and so, no doubt, it was, after rough, broken, rugged, headlong Berkshire, and especially the northern parts of the county, with which his college residence had made him familiar. But to me there is a peculiar, quiet charm in these broad meadows and gentle eminences. They are better than mountains, because they do not stamp and stereotype themselves into the brain, and thus grow wearisome with the same strong impression, repeated day after day. A few summer weeks among mountains, a lifetime among green meadows and placid slopes, with outlines forever new, because continually fading out of the memory,--such would be my sober choice.I doubt whether Eustace did not internally pronounce the whole thing a bore, until I led him to my predecessor's little ruined, rustic summer-house, midway on the hill-side. It is a mere skeleton of slender, decaying tree-trunks, with neither walls nor a roof; nothing but a tracery of branches and twigs, which the next wintry blast will be very likely to scatter in fragments along the terrace. It looks, and is, as evanescent as a dream; and yet, in its rustic net-work of boughs, it has somehow enclosed a hint of spiritual beauty, and has become a true emblem of the subtile and ethereal mind that planned it. I made Eustace Bright sit down on a snow-bank, which had heaped itself over the mossy seat, and gazing through the arched window opposite, he acknowledged that the scene at once grew picturesque."Simple as it looks," said he, "this little edifice seems to be the work of magic. It is full of suggestiveness, and, in its way, is as good as a cathedral. Ah, it would be just the spot for one to sit in, of a summer afternoon, and tell the children some more of those wild stories from the classic myths!""It would, indeed," answered I. "The summer-house itself, so airy and so broken, is like one of those old tales, imperfectly remembered; and these living branches of the Baldwin apple-tree, thrusting themselves so rudely in, are like your unwarrantable interpolations. But, by the by, have you added any more legends to the series, since the publication of the Wonder Book?""Many more," said Eustace; "Primrose, Periwinkle, and the rest of them allow me no comfort of my life, unless I tell them a story every day or two. I have run away from home partly to escape the importunity of those little wretches! But I have written out six of the new stories, and have brought them for you to look over.""Are they as good as the first?" I inquired."Better chosen, and better handled," replied Eustace Bright. "You will say so when you read them.""Possibly not," I remarked. "I know, from my own experience, that an author's last work is always his best one, in his own estimate, until it quite loses the red heat of composition. After that, it falls into its true place, quietly enough. But let us adjourn to my study, and examine these new stories. It would hardly be doing yourself justice, were you to bring me acquainted with them, sitting here on this snowbank!"So we descended the hill to my small, old cottage, and shut ourselves up in the southeastern room, where the sunshine comes in, warmly and brightly, through the better half of a winter's day. Eustace put his bundle of manuscript into my hands; and I skimmed through it pretty rapidly, trying to find out its merits and demerits by the touch of my fingers, as a veteran story-teller ought to know how to do.It will be remembered, that Mr. Bright condescended to avail himself of my literary experience by constituting me editor of the Wonder Book. As he had no reason to complain of the reception of that erudite work by the public, he was now disposed to retain me in a similar position, with respect to the present volume, which he entitled "TANGLEWOOD TALES." Not, as Eustace hinted, that therewas any real necessity for my services as introductor, inasmuch as his own name had become established, in some good degree of favor, with the literary world. But the connection with myself, he was kind enough to say, had been highly agreeable; nor was he by any means desirous, as most people are, of kicking away the ladder that had perhaps helped him to reach his present elevation. My young friend was willing, in short, that the fresh verdure of his growing reputation should spread over my straggling and half-naked boughs; even as I have sometimes thought of training a vine, with its broad leafiness, and purple fruitage, over the worm-eaten posts and rafters of the rustic summer-house. I was not insensible to the advantages of his proposal, and gladly assured him of my acceptance.Merely from the titles of the stories, I saw at once that the subjects were not less rich than those of the former volume; nor did I at all doubt that Mr. Bright's audacity (so far as that endowment might avail) had enabled him to take full advantage of whatever capabilities they offered. Yet, in spite of my experience of his free way of handling them, I did not quite see, I confess, how he could have obviated all the difficulties in the way of rendering them presentable to children. These old legends, so brimming over with everything that is most abhorrent to our Christianized moral sense,--some of them so hideous, others so melancholy and miserable, amid which the Greek tragedians sought their themes, and moulded them into the sternest forms of grief that ever the world saw; was such material the stuff that children's playthings should be made of! How were they to be purified? How was the blessed sunshine to be thrown into them?But Eustace told me that these myths were the most singular things in the world, and that he was invariably astonished, whenever he began to relate one, by the readiness with which it adapted itself to the childish purity of his auditors. The objectionable characteristics seem to be a parasitical growth, having no essential connection with the original fable. They fall away, and are thought of no more, the instant he puts his imagination in sympathy with theinnocent little circle, whose wide-open eyes are fixed so eagerly upon him. Thus the stories (not by any strained effort of the narrator's, but in harmony with their inherent germ) transform themselves, and reassume the shapes which they might be supposed to possess in the pure childhood of the world. When the first poet or romancer told these marvellous legends (such is Eustace Bright's opinion), it was still the Golden Age. Evil had never yet existed; and sorrow, misfortune, crime, were mere shadows which the mind fancifully created for itself, as a shelter against too sunny realities; or, at most, but prophetic dreams, to which the dreamer himself did not yield a waking credence. Children are now the only representatives of the men and women of that happy era; and therefore it is that we must raise the intellect and fancy to the level of childhood, in order to re-create the original myths.I let the youthful author talk as much and as extravagantly as he pleased, and was glad to see him commencing life with such confidence in himself and his performances. A few years will do all that is necessary towards showing him the truth in both respects. Meanwhile, it is but right to say, he does really appear to have overcome the moral objections against these fables, although at the expense of such liberties with their structure as must be left to plead their own excuse, without any help from me. Indeed, except that there was a necessity for it,--and that the inner life of the legends cannot be come at save by making them entirely one's own property,--there is no defence to be made.Eustace informed me that he had told his stories to the children in various situations,--in the woods, on the shore of the lake, in the dell of Shadow Brook, in the play-room, at Tanglewood fireside, and in a magnificent palace of snow, with ice windows, which he helped his little friends to build. His auditors were even more delighted with the contents of the present volume than with the specimens which have already been given to the world. The classically learned Mr. Pringle, too, had listened to two or three of the tales, and censured them even more bitterly than hedid THE THREE GOLDEN APPLES: so that, what with praise, and what with criticism, Eustace Bright thinks that there is good hope of at least as much success with the public as in the case of the Wonder Book.I made all sorts of inquiries about the children, not doubting that there would be great eagerness to hear of their welfare among some good little folks who have written to me, to ask for another volume of myths. They are all, I am happy to say (unless we except Clover), in excellent health and spirits. Primrose is now almost a young lady, and, Eustace tells me, is just as saucy as ever. She pretends to consider herself quite beyond the age to be interested by such idle stories as these; but, for all that, whenever a story is to be told, Primrose never fails to be one of the listeners, and to make fun of it when finished. Periwinkle is very much grown, and is expected to shut up her baby-house and throw away her doll in a month or two more. Sweet Fern has learned to read and write, and has put on a jacket and pair of pantaloons,--all of which improvements I am sorry for. Squash-Blossom, Blue Eye, Plantain, and Buttercup have had the scarlet fever, but came easily through it. Huckleberry, Milkweed, and Dandelion were attacked with the whooping-cough, but bore it bravely, and kept out of doors whenever the sun shone. Cowslip, during the autumn, had either the measles, or some eruption that looked very much like it, but was hardly sick a day. Poor Clover has been a good deal troubled with her second teeth, which have made her meagre in aspect and rather fractious in temper; nor, even when she smiles, is the matter much mended, since it discloses a gap just within her lips, almost as wide as the barn door. But all this will pass over, and it is predicted that she will turn out a very pretty girl.As for Mr. Bright himself, he is now in his senior year at Williams College, and has a prospect of graduating with some degree of honorable distinction at the next Commencement. In his oration for the bachelor's degree, he gives me to understand, he will treat of the classical myths, viewed in the aspect of baby stories, and has agreat mind to discuss the expediency of using up the whole of ancient history for the same purpose. I do not know what he means to do with himself after leaving college, but trust that, by dabbling so early with the dangerous and seductive business of authorship, he will not be tempted to become an author by profession. If so, I shall be very sorry for the little that I have had to do with the matter, in encouraging these first beginnings.I wish there were any likelihood of my soon seeing Primrose, Periwinkle, Dandelion, Sweet Fern, Clover, Plantain, Huckleberry, Milkweed, Cowslip, Buttercup, Blue Eye, and Squash-Blossom again. But as I do not know when I shall revisit Tanglewood, and as Eustace Bright probably will not ask me to edit a third Wonder Book, the public of little folks must not expect to hear any more about those dear children from me. Heaven bless them, and everybody else, whether grown people or children!THE WAYSIDE, CONCORD, MASS,<i>March</i> 13, 1853.All new material copyright � 1999 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC</p><h2>Speak in a Week Flash!

His tools of war demand huge quantities of fodder, fuel, ammunition, and food. All these must be produced, transported, and distributed to contending forces in the field. No one can doubt the importance of feeding Mars in warfare, and it takes no great effort to recognize that logistics has always been a major aspect of large-scale armed struggle. Yet, despite its undeniable importance, surprisingly little has been written about logistics. The literature on warfare is full of the triumphs and tragedies of common soldiers and the brilliance and blundering of generals. But logistics lacks the drama of combat. It can be expressed on balance sheets no more exciting than shopping lists; movement is not measured by the dashing gallop of charging cavalry but by the steady plod of draft horses.<i>Feeding Mars</i> is an important contribution to the study of this essential aspect of warfare as practiced by Western powers from the Middle Ages to the Vietnam War. It deals with logistics across a broader time span than that covered in any other work on the subject and emphasizes the various ways in which the essential materials of war have been produced, acquired, and transported to fighting forces in the field.<i>Feeding Mars</i> makes a major contribution to military history and sheds new light on an important, but too often overlooked, aspect of warfare.</p><p><b>John A.

Evaluating the impact of Mao Ze-dong's thought and action on China's development, it explores the nature of Deng Xiao-ping's "second revolution" that reversed many of Maoist policies that put the country on the road to economic prosperity but which also created serious economic and political imbalances that will continue to plague China in the near future. <b> </b> Develops and sustains a narrative line not usually available in survey histories of China, presenting an internal coherence within each chapter that provides not only an integrated picture of political, cultural, and economic developments but also a convenient foundation to grasp the sequence of fundamental changes in China.

Great learning at home and in the classroom.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman, M.A., is the author and co-author of hundreds popular storybooks and workbooks for children. Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products.

Dyer New York Times bestselling author of Wishes Fulfilled</p><h2>Runaway World: How Globalization is Reshaping Our Lives</h2><p><p><strong>'This little book is full of insights about who we are and where we are going.' - </strong><em>Financial Times</em><br></p> <p>The most accessible book yet by one of the most influential thinkers of our time, <em>Runaway World</em> evaluates the ever-increasing impact of globalization today. Extending his arguments beyond the merely economic, Giddens shows how our growing interdependence directly affects our everyday lives. Neither a cheerleading endorsement of emerging markets, nor a fearful rant on the growth of terrorism or loss of American jobs,&nbsp;this is a book about a world that grows smaller every day, and how those changes are affecting our culture, our traditions, our families, and our politics. Identifying globalization as a true cultural force, this eloquent and important volume is the starting point for anyone concerned about our increasingly interconnected world.</p></p><p>As director of the London School of Economics, Anthony Giddens is one of the world's foremost academics. He has served as an advisor to both President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair, and is closely tied to the center-left idea of "third-way" politics. In this brief book on globalization (drawn from a series of lectures delivered in 1999), Giddens writes, "We are living through a major period of historical transition." Globalization is reordering societies all over the planet, and although the results are sometimes unpredictable, they are heading in a generally positive direction. But not everybody agrees, as the author freely admits: <blockquote> The battleground of the twenty-first century will pit fundamentalism against cosmopolitan tolerance. In a globalising world, where information and images are routinely transmitted across the globe, we are all regularly in contact with others who think differently, and live differently, from ourselves. Cosmopolitans welcome and embrace this cultural complexity. Fundamentalists find it disturbing and dangerous. Whether in the areas of religion, ethnic identity, or nationalism, they take refuge in a renewed and purified tradition--and, quite often, violence. </blockquote> Giddens is not coy about where he stands: "We can legitimately hope that a cosmopolitan outlook will win out." In what is sure to be a controversial chapter, he examines sex and family life through the prism of this fundamentalist-cosmopolitan divide. He is severely critical of what he calls the "traditional family," which he considers an aspect of fundamentalism the world over and an enemy of sexual equality: "I remember what my great aunt once said to me. She must have had one of the longest marriages of anyone, having been with her husband for over 60 years. She once confided that she had been deeply unhappy with him the whole of that time. In her day there was no escape." <i>Runaway World</i> is certain to provoke a lively debate--Giddens would surely have it no other way. <i>--John J. Miller</i><strong>Anthony Giddens</strong> is the director of the London School of Economics and Political Science and been an advisor to both Tony Blair and Bill Clinton.

But her parents felt differently. Giving her a name meaning &#x201c;Courageous Hero,&#x201d; they encouraged her love of learning and science. This engaging biography follows Wu Chien Shiung as she battles sexism and racism to become what <i>Newsweek</i> magazine called the &#x201c;Queen of Physics&#x201d; for her work on beta decay. Along the way, she earned the admiration of famous scientists like Enrico Fermi and Robert Oppenheimer and became the first woman hired as an instructor by Princeton University, the first woman elected President of the American Physical Society, the first scientist to have an asteroid named after her when she was still alive, and many other honors.</p><p>Teresa Robeson was born in Hong Kong, raised in Canada, and now writes and creates from her mini-homestead in southern Indiana where she lives with her scientist husband.

Rebecca received her MFA degree in illustration from Academy of Art University in San Francisco. She is the author and illustrator of&nbsp;<i>Bobo and the New Baby</i>. You can visit her at&nbsp;rebeccamhuang.com.&#x201c;To have a girl child in China at the turn of the last century was not considered fortunate for most families. But the Wu family was not like most, and Chien Shiung was not only encouraged to go to school (her parents were educators), she was told she could be whatever she wanted. That support was taken to heart, and Robeson details in short but informative bites of text how the young woman extended her education, moving ever further from home and finally to the U.S., where she would delve deeply into her passion, the study of atoms. Writing biographies about people from different times and cultures can have challenges, but trying to explain physics&#x2014;especially Wu's specialization, beta decay&#x2014;in a picture-book biography certainly ups the ante. Robeson surmounts these almost effortlessly, getting to the heart of Wu's professional life and simply detailing her many accomplishments, as well as informing her audience how Wu was slighted when it came to awards like the Nobel Prize, with male colleagues taking the honors. The text's accessibility is supported and enhanced by Huang's collage-style artwork that captures Wu's dedication and willingness to take on leadership roles both in the scientific community and in leading political protests in China. <b>Wu Chien Shiung's story is remarkable&#x2014;and so is the way this book does it justice</b>. A short biography and a dictionary of physics terms is appended.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i> (Starred review)<br><br> &#x201c;A wonderfully written biography of an important woman scientist hardly known outside of her field of physics. Yes, the difficult science is thoroughly understandable in this picture book biography, but it is the heroism and ethical components of the main character, Madame Wu, whom we follow from birth into old age that centers this powerful little book. Not just for little girls, but for children of all ages. About achievement, honesty, hard work that follows a passion. Do not miss this one.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jane Yolen, author of <i>Owl Moon, How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight</i>, and many other books<br><br> &#x201c;Robeson details the life of Wu Chien Shiung, a female physicist of the mid-20th century who completed important, often unrecognized work in beta decay. Fortunate to have parents who started a girls&#x2019; school in China, Wu was educated like her brothers, attended university, and led student protests to &#x2018;resist Japanese invaders&#x2019; just before WWII.

It situates them as fellow explorers. . . . It asks them to draw on their own experiences a great deal throughout the text and, along with being &#x2018;inviting,&#x2019; that strategy clearly tells readers that they are co-constructors of knowledge, that their experiences are valid.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>Patricia Webb, Arizona State University (reviewer)</b></p> <p>&#x201c;I believe that the selection of readings that accompany each of the kinds of writing (reflecting, observing, informing, etc.) are superb choices, because their subjects are contemporary and of interest to students and also provide a variety of genres&#x2013;from articles to essays to blogs and leaflets.&#x201d; &#x2014; <b>Martha Petry, Jackson Community College </b></p> <p>&#x201c;One of the problems with most textbooks is they overwhelm readers with written text; this textbook doesn&#x2019;t do that.

In this collection of addresses, discussions, question-and-answer sessions, and lectures&#x2015;which paralleled his major medical courses&#x2015;Steiner comments on contemporary medical emphasis on experimental, materially based research and its lack of attention to therapy. Steiner&#x2019;s intention is not to detract from developments in medical science but to build on them with spiritual science. The medical practitioner has an important task&#x2015;diseases must be cured, and it is wrong not to intervene and simply to allow &#x201c;karma to take its course.&#x201d;<br><br>Speaking both to the general public and to small groups of medical professionals, Steiner offers new insights into our understanding of human organs, as well as the efficacy of healing substances such as arsenic, sulfur, arnica, and essential plant oils. He studies a broad range of specific medical conditions, offering advice on cancer, hysteria, rheumatism, gout, skin eruptions, typhoid, diabetes, hemophilia, syphilis, gonorrhea, asthma, glaucoma, leukemia, smallpox, insomnia, and childhood diseases such as measles. His commentaries on subjects such as psychiatry, sexual maturity, memory, poisoning, and detoxification present challenging perspectives for both patients and medical practitioners. Steiner&#x2019;s surprisingly non-dogmatic advice on vaccination, for example, gives a refreshingly balanced and, perhaps unexpected, point of view.<br><br><b>READ A REVIEW OF THIS BOOK BY BOBBY MATHERNE</b><br><br>This volume is a translation from German of <i>Physiologisch- Therapeutisches auf Grundlage der Geisteswissenschaft</i> (GA 314).

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Literature in the Roman World</h2><p>In this volume, we are offered a new perspective on Roman literature, based on the conviction that our present appreciation for it should be informed and influenced by how it was originally perceived.

Several important strides have been made in this field during the past few years, especially in the contrast enhancement of conventional and color Doppler images. The book begins with chapters on the history of contrast echocardiography, the principles of contrast echo and descriptions of new contrast agents capable of transpulmonary passage following intravenous injection. Safety issues in contrast echocardiography are also discussed. The second section of the book deals with clinical uses of echo contrast agents. Their usefulness in the identification of cardiac structures and assessment of pathological lesions using both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography are fully discussed. Technical and practical considerations in the use of various contrast agents are also described. The use of contrast echo in the identification of cardiac sources of embolism as well as possible mechanisms and clinical significance of spontaneous contrast echoes are also covered. Six chapters fully discuss the basics of contrast enhancement of conventional and color Doppler images and its clinical utility in the noninvasive assessment of pulmonary artery pressure, regurgitant and stenotic lesions and in the delineation of coronary arteries. Another chapter describes the non-cardiac applications of the echo contrast enhancement technique. The final section of the book investigates the role of echo contrast enhancement in quantitative cardiovascular analysis.</p><p><strong>`</strong> Nanda and Schlief have edited and produced an authoritative and up-to-date reference book for both experienced and inexperienced echocardiologists.

America's leading rocket expert and most enthusiastic advocate of space travel, he had a closet full of secrets that would have shocked his colleagues and millions of admirers if they had been told during his lifetime. <i>Wernher von Braun:The Man Who Sold the Moon</i> is the first critical biography of the young German aristocrat who created Hitler's most advanced terror weapon, the V-2 rocket, and who came to the U.S. under the Army's Project Paperclip to develop missiles as a central weapon of the Cold War. The book reveals that factions of the U.S. Army, in their zeal to have von Braun's team of scientists working for American interests, covered up what they knew about his complicity in Nazi causes and abetted him in the perpetuation of the myth he carefully created about his past.</p><p></p><p>Declassified Army documents and war crime transcripts, as well as the discovery of Europe of Dora concentration camp survivors' accounts, and von Braun's published writings and personal papers, have enabled biographer Dennis Piszkiewicz to document von Braun's career more fully than any previous historian. The man who tirelessly promoted space travel, worked with NASA to collaborate with Walt Disney creating television programs and the Tomorrowland section of Disneyland, and put the first astronauts on the moon, was actually a member of the Nazi party, held a rank in the SS equivalent to that of Major, and was an accomplice in the use of slave labor from the Dora concentration camp to produce his V-2 rocket. When the Third Reich collapsed, von Braun unashamedly switched his allegiance to the victor, and adroitly distanced himself from his Nazi partners. By going on to promote NASA and sell the American people on his dreams of space exploration, he became the man who sold the moon&#x2015;a man who began his brilliant career by selling his soul to the Nazis.</p></p><p><p>This first critical biography of America's leading rocket expert and advocate of space exploration reveals that von Braun and factions of the U.S. Army deliberately hid his past: membership in the Nazi party, a rank of Major in Hitler's SS, and complicity in the use of slave labor from Nazi concentration camps to build the Third Reich's V-2 rockets.</p><p>DENNIS PISZKIEWICZ has been an enthusiast of space exploration since his childhood in the 1950s. He has taught college-level chemistry and biochemistry and has been the recipient of a NASA fellowship.

In this richly-illustrated book sculptures of the human form constructed of thread, sticks, cantaloupe peels, and beads are pictured. Interiors of five collectors&#39; homes are presented showing the pleasure and comfort the owners derive from living with their handsome, provocative, even surreal possessions. It is art that invites touching. Polly Ullrich delighted in finding art-historical precedents for the objects produced between the mid-twentieth to the early 21st centuries by an international group fo creators whose work has been accepted into private and public collections in the Midwest and around the world. The artists represented mined (and modified) traditional techniques from fields outside painting and sculpture, especially textile arts. Crocheted thread, twisted wire, embroidered drawings, woven hangings, stapled photographs, zippered wood, expoxied burlap, and knotted maps are used in some of the pieces selected. A diverse palette of animal products are employed including: exotic feathers, human hair, fish skin, hog casing, and egg shells.

They are told that they sound inarticulate and that if they speak correct&#x201d; English, with no sign of Spanish influence most particularly with no accent, they will get better jobs. In short, Puerto Ricans in the United States are told that the origins of their economic and social problems are linguistic and can be remedied through personal effort, when in fact their fundamental problems stem from racial and class exclusion.Concepts like mixed&#x201d; or broken&#x201d; languages, and good&#x201d; and bad&#x201d; English are cultural constructions and therefore are about more than language. In the Puerto Rican experience of devaluation and prejudice in the United States, the institutionalization of racial exclusion and class location are mapped onto English and Spanish in complex and highly politicized ways. Formal linguistic studies of bilingualism rarely engage this process in a significant way. But the place, function, and meaning of cultural constructs within the politicized communicative economy must be understood in terms of the intersections of race, class, and language that shape the lives of working-class Puerto Ricans. Working from ethnographic studies and interviews done on New York's Lower East Side and in the Bronx, this book examines that intersection in detail.</p><p><b>Bonnie Urciuoli</b> is associate professor of anthropology at Hamilton College.</p><h2>The Best American Essays, College Edition</h2><p>THE BEST AMERICAN ESSAYS, Seventh College Edition, presents highly regarded contemporary authors at their best.

From the moment that the prior at the monastery complained to Leonardo that the work was taking too long, the <i>Last Supper</i> has endured centuries of controversy, neglect, and difficulty. <i>Leonardo, The Last Supper</i>, translated from the Italian, is the definitive document of the recently completed project to reverse these centuries of decline by restoring the painting and preserving it in a manner that generations of conservators have failed to do.<br><br>The technical problems with the <i>Last Supper</i> began as soon as Leonardo started to paint it. He jettisoned the traditional fresco technique of applying paint to wet plaster, a method unsuited to Leonardo's slow and thorough execution, and created the work instead with an experimental technique that involved painting directly on the dry plaster. With this renegade method, Leonardo rendered one of the most enduring painting techniques volatile and unstable. Added to this initial complication have been centuries of pollution, tourists, candle smoke, and the ravages of age, not to mention food fights in the refectory staged by Napoleonic soldiers and Allied bombs in 1943. By the middle of the twentieth century, the <i>Last Supper</i> was in desperate need of a complete restoration.<br><br>Pinin Brambilla Barcilon was chosen to head this twenty-year project, and <i>Leonardo, The Last Supper</i> is the official record of her remarkable effort. It first documents the cleaning and removal of the overpainting performed in the other attempts at restoration and then turns to Barcilon's meticulous additions in watercolor, which were based on Leonardo's preparatory drawings, early copies of the painting, and contemporary textual descriptions. This book presents full-scale reproductions of details from the fresco that clearly display and distinguish Leonardo's hand from that of the restorer. With nearly 400 sumptuous color reproductions, the most comprehensive technical documentation of the project by Barcilon, and an introductory essay by art historian and project codirector Pietro C. Marani that focuses on the history of the fresco, <i>Leonardo, The Last Supper</i> is an invaluable historic record, an extraordinarily handsome book, and an essential volume for anyone who appreciates the beauty, technical achievements, and fate of Renaissance painting.<br></p><p>Leonardo's <i>The Last Supper</i>, painted in tempera on the damp walls of a dining room for the Dominican monks of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan, began falling apart in his lifetime. Five centuries of dust, mildew, and bad treatment (including vandalism by French 18th-century troops, Allied bombs in World War II, and various ham-handed attempts at cleaning and repainting) have only made things worse. The most recent restoration team went about the job with surgical precision, beginning in 1977. While much of the original is irrevocably lost, the fragments of paint that remain still form a deeply evocative and exquisitely rendered composition, and many of the faces have gained increased visibility and plasticity. More than 200 full-color pages painstakingly document every inch of the ghostly surface. Beginning with full views, the focus narrows until each image is presented in its actual size, interleaved with an all-black page for heightened clarity. To look so closely at the fragile network of paint flecks is to be acutely aware of the mystery of perception--that these flecks of color allow us to read each apostle's mood and personality as they reacted to Christ's words ("One of you will betray me"). The commentary, printed in pleasingly large type and fluidly translated from the Italian, is segregated from the major reproductions, allowing the fresco to speak for itself. An introductory text traces the history of the painting and its restorations, as well as shifts in critical opinion. In a lengthy, generously illustrated section at the back of the book, chief curator Pinin Brambilla Barcilon explains how she restored each portion of the masterwork. While this may be more than the casual reader cares to know, extraordinary attention to detail is one of the hallmarks of both the project and the book. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i><b>Pinin Brambilla Barcilon</b> is one of the world's foremost authorities on the conservation of Renaissance frescoes. She has published widely on the subject and is responsible for a number of important technical advancements in the field. For the last twenty years, she has served as the chief conservator of the project to restore the <i>Last Supper</i>. <br><br><b>Pietro C.

This play is the genuine article--it's got the goods on the human condition, all packed into a day in the life of one self-deluded, self-promoting, self-defeating soul. It's a sturdy bridge between kitchen-sink realism and spectral abstraction, the facts of particular hard times and universal themes. As Christopher Bigsby's mildly interesting afterword in this 50th-anniversary edition points out (as does Miller in his memoir, <i>Timebends</i>), Willy is closely based on the playwright's sad, absurd salesman uncle, Manny. But of course Miller made Manny into Everyman, and gave him the name of the crime commissioner Lohmann in Fritz Lang's angst-ridden 1932 Nazi parable, <i>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</i>.<p> The tragedy of Loman the all-American dreamer and loser works eternally, on the page as on the stage. A lot of plays made history around 1949, but none have stepped out of history into the classic canon as <i>Salesman</i> has. Great as it was, Tennessee Williams's work can't be revived as vividly as this play still is, all over the world. (This edition has edifying pictures of Lee J. Cobb's 1949 and Brian Dennehy's 1999 performances.) It connects Aristotle, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, <i>On the Waterfront</i>, David Mamet, and the archetypal American movie antihero. It even transcends its author's tragic flaw of pious preachiness (which undoes his snoozy <i>The Crucible</i>, unfortunately his most-produced play).</p><p> No doubt you've seen Willy Loman's story at least once. It's still worth reading. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Stacy Keach and Jane Kaczmarek stars in Arthur Miller's 1949 masterpiece, a searing portrait of the physical, emotional, and psychological costs of the American dream. Willy Loman (Keach) is the play's iconic traveling salesman, whose family is torn apart by his desperate obsession with greatness and social acceptance. As his two sons cast about aimlessly for their station in life, Willy begins to come unraveled when the reality of his life threatens his long-cherished illusions. <p> A full cast L.A.

He demonstrates case after case of positive human engagement in the environment and of managed ecosystems and restored areas that are richer, more diverse, and healthier than unmanaged ones. Much of pre-Columbian America, he contends, was not a pristine wilderness but an ancient garden managed over millennia by native peoples who shaped the plant and animal communities around them to the mutual benefit of all. What Dagget is proposing is a radical change in the way we define land health and the ways this health can be achieved. Rather than leaving the land alone, he recommends a new kind of environmentalism based on management, science, evolution, and holism, and served by humans who enrich the environment even as they benefit from it. In this way, we humans can resume our ancient role as gardeners and stewards of our world, reviving damaged land, facilitating the return of native species, restoring the land&#39;s ability to absorb and store water and carbon. ecological crisis and a new purpose for our human energies and ideals.

The final of the men's 100 metres at those Olympics is certainly the most infamous in the history of athletics, and more indelibly etched into the consciousness of the sport, the Olympics, and a global audience of millions, than any other athletics event before or since.</p><p>Ben Johnson's world-record time of 9.79 seconds &#x2013; as thrilling as it was &#x2013; was the beginning rather than the end of the story. Following the race, Johnson tested positive, news that generated as many &#x2013; if not more &#x2013; shockwaves as his fastest ever run. He was stripped of the title, Lewis was awarded the gold medal, Linford Christie the silver and Calvin Smith the bronze.</p><p>More than two decades on, the story still hadn't ended. In 1999 Lewis was named Sportsman of the Century by the IOC, and Olympian of the Century by Sports Illustrated. Yet his reputation was damaged by revelations that he too used performance-enhancing drugs, and tested positive prior to the Seoul Olympics. Christie also tested positive in Seoul but his explanation, that the banned substance had been in ginseng tea, was accepted. Smith, now a lecturer in English literature at a Florida university, was the only athlete in the top five whose reputation remains unblemished &#x2013; the others all tested positive at some stage in their careers.</p><p>Containing remarkable new revelations, this book uses witness interviews - with Johnson, Lewis and Smith among others - to reconstruct the build-up to the race, the race itself, and the fallout when news of Johnson's positive test broke and he was forced into hiding. It also examines the rivalry of the two favourites going into it, and puts the race in a historical context, examining its continuing relevance on the sport today, where every new record elicits scepticism.</p></p><p>Richard Moore is an award-winning sports journalist with several books to his name including <i>In Search of Robert Millar</i> and <i>Heroes, Villains and Velodromes</i>.&#x201c;It is always a sign of a good book that you pick it up and never want to put it down.

Among the many books available on Frank Lloyd Wright, William Allin Storrer's classic&#x2014;now fully revised and updated&#x2014;remains the only authoritative guide to all of Wright's built work.<br><br>This edition includes a number of new features. It provides information on Frank Lloyd Wright buildings discovered since the first edition. It features full-color photographs to highlight those buildings that remain essentially as they were first built. To facilitate its use as a convenient field guide, this durable flexibound edition gives full addresses with each entry, as well as GPS coordinates, and offers maps giving the shortest route to each building. Preserving the chronological order of past editions, the catalog allows readers to trace the progression of Frank Lloyd Wright's built designs from the early Prairie school works to the last building constructed to Wright's specifications on the original site&#x2014;the Aime and Norman Lykes residence.<br><br><i>The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright</i> will be indispensable for anyone fascinated with Wright's unique architectural genius.<br></p><p><b>William Allin Storrer</b> holds a Ph.D. in comparative arts. He is the author of <i>The Frank Lloyd Wright Companion</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.&#34;Storrer, who has written on Wright for a quarter century, has produced the first true and complete catalogue raisonne of Wright&#39;s work, and it is stunning.... He has taken the vast forest of Wright&#39;s built work and looked at it tree by tree, labeling each and every one of those trees thoroughly and intriguingly. It is a testament to Mr. Storrer&#39;s skill that this book comes off not merely as a catalogue, but as an inspiring study of the whole Wright forest.&#34; - Paul Goldberger, New York Times</p><h2>The Chinese Garden (Images of Asia)</h2><p>Whether built for imperial use or for the enjoyment of a private scholar and his family, the garden is a centerpiece of classical Chinese culture. This book draws on a wide range of literary and artistic sources to present the fundamentals of Chinese garden design. Illustrated with photographs showing detailed views of sites in Suzhou and Yangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, it explains the aesthetic principles and practical concerns of the designer. The &#34;reading&#34; of a Chinese garden that it offers is enriched by a greater understanding of the literary and artistic conventions involved in the gardens construction.</p><p><br><strong>Joseph Cho Wang</strong> is Professor of Architecture at Virginia Polytechnic Institute in the USA.<br></p><h2>Leaping Lizards (MathStart 1)</h2><p><p>Stuart J.

She now lives in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>PreS-K. Part of the ongoing Math Start series, which offers math concepts in picture-book format for a variety of levels, this book introduces the multiples of five, as lizards of different colors travel through the pages on unicycles, a hot-air balloon, an airplane, and other modes of transport, while a green snake looks on. Finally, the number 50 is reached, and lizards explode in all directions. Written in short couplets, the simple text describes the ever-increasing number of lizards, but the highlight of the book is the effective design. An intelligent blending of white space and colors make each double-page spread visually stand out. A box on one side of each page helps children keep track of the multiplying lizards, and a closing section offers adults a few more ideas for easy math education. <i>Todd Morning</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

(Think jaw worms that consume fungus, bacteria in the ocean, and flour mites in our kitchen cabinets.) This title explores microscopic animals in 10 distinct habitats.

Each spread has an additional foldout component that introduces the habitat and further explains the creatures depicted in the illustration. The scale for each environment being portrayed is indicated, as is the amount of magnification. The truly masterly illustrations are colorful, with meticulous attention to detail; they succeed in being both otherworldly and rooted in scientific fact.

A large illustration shows a magnified version of the tiny creatures in each setting on a full spread, with some numbered. A flap provides an overview of the setting and its creatures. Opening the flap reveals identifying labels and brief paragraphs about each numbered creature, emphasizing the hidden nature of the microscopic world. Appendices on microscopes and classification add depth. A glossary, index, brief source list, and authors&#x2019; note round out the back matter. Though creative, the book is not perfect: magnification is noted without being fully explained, and the numbers in the illustrations can be challenging to locate. In addition, many of the tiny creatures recur on multiple pages without new information, making those parts somewhat repetitive. Despite these minor flaws, the book successfully and attractively illuminates microscopic worlds for readers to discover&#x2015;but beware the sections that zoom in on microorginisms residing in the bed, kitchen, and human skin.

The wide variety of exercises, which range from computational to more conceptual and which are of vary� ing difficulty, cover the following subjects and more: real numbers, limits, continuous functions, differentiation and elementary integration, normed vector spaces, compactness, series, integration in one variable, improper integrals, convolutions, Fourier series and the Fourier integral, functions in n-space, derivatives in vector spaces, the inverse and implicit mapping theorem, ordinary differential equations, multiple integrals, and differential forms. My objective is to offer those learning and teaching analysis at the undergraduate level a large number of completed exercises and I hope that this book, which contains over 600 exercises covering the topics mentioned above, will achieve my goal. The exercises are an integral part of Lang&#39;s book and I encourage the reader to work through all of them. In some cases, the problems in the beginning chapters are used in later ones, for example, in Chapter IV when one constructs-bump functions, which are used to smooth out singulari� ties, and prove that the space of functions is dense in the space of regu� lated maps. The numbering of the problems is as follows. Exercise IX. 5. 7 indicates Exercise 7, �5, of Chapter IX.

A proper English lad, Kim is plunged into an exotic and unfamiliar world of crowded bazaars and noisy markets, gilded temples, sahibs and fakirs, beggars, whirling dervishes, soldiers, and spies. Forced to live hand-to-mouth, Kim must rely on his cunning and wit to survive.<br><br>But his life takes a curious twist when he meets a holy man, a lama, who is about to embark on a very mysterious quest: a pilgrimage that will take him across the vast continent, across mighty rivers and up the majestic Himalayas. He wants Kim to accompany him.<br><br>But where will the journey lead? For Kim, all roads lead to adventure!<br><br></p><p>One of the particular pleasures of reading <i>Kim</i> is the full range of emotion, knowledge, and experience that Rudyard Kipling gives his complex hero. Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized. Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore: <blockquote> Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest. </blockquote> From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of "'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'" <p> In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing "commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion." His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his "love of the game for its own sake," makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raises <i>Kim</i> above the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kim is an orphan, living from hand to mouth in the teeming streets of Lahore. One day he meets a man quite unlike anything in his wide experience, a Tibetan lama on a quest. Kim's life suddenly acquires meaning and purpose as he becomes the lama's guide and protector--his chela. Other forces are at work as Kim is sucked into the intrigue of the Great Game and travels the Grand Trunk Road with his lama.<p></p><p>How Kim and the lama meet their respective destinies on the road and in the mountains of India forms one of the most compelling adventure tales of all time.</p></p><h2>Ethics and World Politics</h2><p>Ideal for courses in international relations and political theory, <em>Ethics and World Politics</em> explores the ethical dimensions of some of the most complex problems in world politics.

A highly recommended text for all those involved in teaching courses on ethics in world politics."--Andrew Hurrell, <em>Oxford University</em><p></p><br>"Useful to both students and advanced scholars, this is a superb collection of essays by major contemporary thinkers in international politics and political theory. The essays offer innovative readings of both familiar modes of international relations thinking (e.g. Realism) and more recent ones (e.g. Critical Theory). Although sophisticated, each chapter is clearly written and organized, with many down-to-earth examples complementing the theoretical analysis. This is quite simply the best single volume now available for use in courses on international relations theory and international political thought. Highly recommended!"--William E. Scheuerman, <em>Indiana University</em><p></p><br>"<em>Ethics and World Politics</em> is the leading interdisciplinary introduction to justice beyond borders. Global poverty and inequality, democracy, war, terrorism, human rights, military intervention, immigration, national identity, and other vital issues are explored by some of our leading authors. The dominant theoretical frameworks for debating these topics are explained with unusual clarity. This is an excellent text for students working at the intersection of Politics, International Relations, and Philosophy on some of the most crucial questions in the world."--Leif Wenar, <em>Kings College</em> <em>London</em><p></p><br>"A fabulously clear and comprehensive introduction to the issues, <em>Ethics and Global Politics</em> reaches past the partisan, conceptual divides that characterize "the literature" (normative versus descriptive, realism versus idealism, continental versus analytical approaches, political theory versus International Relations) and shines a light on such sadly overlooked questions as the inequitable patterns of global suffering, the problem of international and post-colonial inequality, and the politics of human rights. This volume's refreshingly value-laden account of how politics works in global settings will be especially useful to those new to the field and to those who teach them."--Bonnie Honig, Sarah Rebecca Roland, <em>Northwestern University</em><p></p><br>"How am I to act in a world of increasingly close contact and interdependence? Should I become a vegetarian as a way to decrease global inequality? What do we owe each other if the boundaries of our moral concern are no longer co-terminus with political boundaries? Should I oppose all war as a violation of human rights or champion humanitarian intervention as a way to promote democracy and human rights? The authors of these essays don't give us the answers to these questions so much as give us the tools to reason about both the questions and possible answers. The essays in Ethics and World Politics provide an important resource: the background to understand the complex world we face and competing ways--from highly qualified and diverse contributors--to think through the urgent problems that humanity now faces."--Neta C.

The authors believe in the importance of having a hands-on relationship with nature while maintaining a healthy respect for it, and stress safety precautions and preparation. The chapters feature directions for making inexpensive equipment and projects while exploring nature; crafts; outdoor games; and recipes for snacks and meals.

Nan Fink Gefen teaches you how to meditate on your own, and starts you on the path to a deeper connection with the Divine and to greater insight about your own life. Whatever your level of understanding, she gives you the tools and support you need to discover the transformative power of meditation. </p> <p>This most comprehensive introduction to a time-honored spiritual practice: </p> <ul><li> Answers commonly asked questions about the nature and history of Jewish meditation, and examines how it differs from other meditative practices </li> <li>Shows beginners how to start their practice, including where and how to do it </li> <li>Gives step by step instructions for meditations that are at the core of Jewish meditative practice </li> <li>Explains the challenges and rewards of a Jewish meditative practice</li></ul></p><p><p><b>Nan Fink Gefen, PhD</b>, is a teacher of Jewish meditation, a writer and an editor. She has taught Jewish meditation to hundreds of students around the country. For six years, she directed a program to train Jewish meditation teachers at Chochmat HaLev, a center of Jewish meditation in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>She is a contributor to <i>Meditation from the Heart of Judaism: Today's Teachers Share Their Practices, Techniques, and Faith</i> (Jewish Lights), and author of <i>Stranger in the Midst: A Memoir of Spiritual Discovery</i> (Basic Books). She cofounded <i>Tikkun</i> magazine in 1985, and she is the cofounding editor of <i>Persimmon Tree: An Online Magazine of the Arts</i>.</p>Gefen, cofounder of Tikkun magazine and codirector of Chochmat HaLev, a Jewish meditation center in Berkeley, Calif., declares that although we may think that meditation belongs to the Buddhists, it is authentically Jewish. Indeed, Gefen finds references to meditation in Genesis (when Jacob spent time alone before his reconciliation with Esau, for example) and the Psalms. By the Middle Ages, Jewish mediation had "gone underground," though it was practiced by some Kabbalists and later claimed by the Hasidim. But readers don't need to become black-hatted mystics to take advantage of the tradition: this book encourages Jews of all persuasions to give meditation a shot. Gefen maintains a strict view of what is, and is not, meditation. In prayer, the goal is to communicate directly with God, whereas meditation attempts "to move into a spiritually open state, and then we experience whatever is there. This may include directly sensing God's presence. Or, it may not." Gefen teaches 13 basic meditations, from the Hineni meditation to a thankfulness meditation. This book is a worthwhile addition to the Jewish library, but it will never replace Aryeh Kaplan's Jewish Meditation: A Practical Guide (reprinted in 1995) as the essential reading on the subject.

Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br>NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b>The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br>As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br>Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b>Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br>The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.In recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing "seminars." James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.<br><br>James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)<p>Off the coast of Brazil, a team of scientists discovers an island where all life has been eradicated by a species beyond imagination.

He traces his hacker roots to his high school days in the late '70s, when he first played with a distant computer over highspeed, 300-baud phone lines. It didn't take long for him to get into trouble by figuring out how to access something he wasn&#x2019;t supposed to access. He continued playing with various machines in his college days at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. This resulted in an FBI raid, as he once again gained access to something he really shouldn't have. It was in the midst of all this excitement that he cofounded <i>2600 Magazine</i>, an outlet for hacker stories and tutorials from all over the world. The rapid growth and success of the magazine was both shocking and scary to Goldstein, who to this day has never taken a course in computers. Since 1988, he has also hosted <i>Off The Hook</i>, a hacker-themed technology talk show on WBAI 99.5 FM in New York City. In addition to making the hacker documentary <i>Freedom Downtime</i>, Goldstein hosts the Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE) conferences in New York City every two years, drawing thousands of hackers from all over the world.</p><h2>Out of Italy</h2><p>By 1450, all of Europe and the Mediterranean were influenced by the teachings, the economies and the intellect of Italy. Its predominance had been achieved through a long history of effort, patience and strategic victories. How had Italy, or rather a handful of Italian cities, a few men all told, succeed in acquiring and maintaining a position of dominance <i>vis-�-vis</i> Byzantium, Islam, and western Europe?<br><br>In this fascinating and insightful study, Fernand Braudel, one of the most distinguished historians of our time, examines the many-sided phenomenon of greatness that characterized Italy during the two centuries spanning the Renaissance, Mannerism, and the Baroque-- dazzling, multicoloured Italy, whose radiance shone all over Europe. Braudel perceptively describes the extent, nature and force of Italian influence abroad, analyses the complex interaction between art, science, politics and commerce, and proposes a paradigm of Italy's extraordinary cultural flowering.<br><br>This is the first English translation of Braudel's now-classic text. The volume is beautifully designed and illustrated with works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, Ghirlandaio, van Eyck, Rubens, Caron, and Poussin. It is an invaluable work for students of Italian history who will find that their understanding of Italian culture has been immeasurably enriched.<br></p><p><b>Fernand Braudel </b>was born in Lum�ville-en-Ornois in 1902. He graduated in history in 1923, and subsequently taught in Algiers, S�o Paulo and Paris. Beginning in 1940 he spent five years as a prisoner of war in Germany, during which he wrote his thesis <i>La M�diterran�e et le monde m�diterran�en � l'�poque de Philippe II</i>, published in France in 1949. In 1946 he became a member of the editorial board of the journal <i>Annales</i>, founded by Marc Bloch and Lucien Febvre. In 1949 he succeeded Febvre at the College de France. From 1962 to his death in 1985 Braudel was chief administrator of the Maison des Sciences de l'Homme.<br><br>Fernand Braudel achieved a worldwide reputation for his line of approach that united history and other social studies. His <i>Civilization and Capitalism</i> and<i> The Mediterranean</i> were widely acclaimed.<br><br>The second volume of Fernand Braudel's monumental <i>The Identity of France</i> was published in 1990.<br></p><h2>Current Issues In Nursing (Current Issues in Nursing (McCloskey))</h2><p><p>Current Issues in Nursing provides a forum for knowledgeable debate on the important issues that nurses face today.

It provides an original interpretation of not only the Soviet collapse, but also of the phenomenon of nationalism more generally. Probing the role of nationalist action as both cause and effect, Beissinger utilizes extensive event data and detailed case studies from across the U.S.S.R. during its final years to elicit the shifting relationship between pre-existing structural conditions, institutional constraints, and event-generated influences in the massive nationalist explosions that brought about the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p><p>"This important book should be an essential tool in a variety of social science disciplines." American Journal of Sociology<br><br>"Nationalist Mobilization and the Collapse of the Soviet State is a big, original book brimming with conceptual innovation on two much-visited topics: nationalist movements and the Soviet collapse. Mark Beissinger constructs a rigorous empirical edifice that serves to advance his first-rate theoretical reflection rather than to overwhelm it. This carefully balanced study of nationalist mobilization as a series of waves is a model for those seeking a blend of quantitative and qualitative approaches to worthy subjects...[This book] should prove useful for graduate and sophisticated undergraduate-level courses on transnational movements, nationalism, and post-Soviet politics. The book's carefully constructed arguments and weave of evidence make for absorbing reading and will likely stimulate fruitful discussion." Perspectives on Politics<br><br>"Nationalist Mobilization and the Collapse of the Soviet State is a very serious analytical work, which, no doubt, will attract the attention of many political scientists, especially those studying political processes in Russia and the post-Soviet area. . . the work of Mark Beissinger is quite important for the understanding of nationalism as a social and political phenomenon. It is also a good step forward in the research of etho-political processes in the post-Soviet area, especially those connected to the political mobilization of ethnicity. . . [It] has not only theoretical, but also practical importance."

With its even-handed presentation of realism, liberalism, constructivism, and critical theory and comprehensive coverage of all of the major concepts in IR,<em> Perspectives on International Relations</em> gives students the set of analytical tools they need to become effective readers and thinkers about the world&#x2019;s most urgent issues.</p><p><b>Making sense of today&#x2019;s world events means being able to read beyond the headlines. </b></p><p><em>Perspectives on International Relations</em> combines comprehensive coverage with class-tested, fully integrated critical thinking pedagogy to teach students how to "read between the lines."</p><p>These are features your students won&#x2019;t skip&#x2015;they&#x2019;re too useful and engaging:</p><ul><li>"Using the Perspectives to Read Between the Lines" boxes model critical reading, showing students how to identify and think through the viewpoints playing out in contemporary debates;</li><li>"Perspectives and Levels of Analysis" tables help students track the ways each perspective interprets events from the individual, domestic, and systemic levels;</li><li>"Parallel Timelines" exhibit how the perspectives preference different events, from the origins of WWI to the current era;</li><li>"Spotlight" icons highlight when key concepts in IR (e.g., alliances, anarchy, balance of power) are at work in historical or contemporary cases;</li><li>"Causal Arrow" icons point to when a perspective is emphasized over others in explaining the cause of an event; and</li><li>A marginal glossary defines every key term in the book.</li></ul><p><b>What&#x2019;s New? </b></p><p>The book&#x2019;s distinctive approach has been sharpened, with refined discussion of the major viewpoints in IR. Chapters have been streamlined so that key points are crystal clear. Every chapter has been fully updated and features the latest in world affairs and advancements in scholarship with:</p><ul><li>coverage of the global financial crisis, explaining in straightforward terms the operation of global debt, derivatives, and currency markets, as well as the interconnection of domestic, trade, and investment policies;</li><li>closer examination of new dynamics in ethnic conflict and terrorism;</li><li>a look at the contrast between the foreign policy orientations of the George W. Bush and Obama administrations;</li><li>discussion of the debate surrounding the Millennium Development Goals and the latest findings related to global governance, climate change, and population movements;</li><li>deeper analysis of international institutional changes, such as the G-20 summits and the redistribution of voting rights in international economic institutions; and</li><li>new insights on human rights, including women&#x2019;s rights in Muslim countries and the growing role of NGOs in holding repressive regimes accountable.</li></ul><p><b>What Remains the Same? </b></p><p>The book&#x2019;s value price. With a suggested retail price of $76.95, Nau costs your students $20 to $80 less than the leading competitors&#x2015;without skimping on coverage, currency, content, or ancillaries.</p></p><p><p>Henry R. Nau has combined an outstanding career in the academic world with two opportunities to serve at the highest levels of the U.S. government. He brings this experience to bear in this textbook, integrating theory and practice with unprecedented clarity for understanding historical and contemporary issues in world affairs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nau is currently professor of political science and international affairs at the Elliott School of International Affairs, George Washington University. He taught previously at Williams College and held visiting appointments at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, Stanford University, and Columbia University. From 1977 to 1981, Nau served on the Board of Editors of the journal <i>International Organization</i>.<i> </i>He has received research grants from, among others, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the National Science Foundation, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Smith-Richardson Foundation, the Century Foundation, the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission, the Hoover Institution, the Rumsfeld Foundation, and the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nau served from 1975 to 1977 as special assistant to the undersecretary for economic affairs, Charles Robinson, in the U.S. Department of State. In that capacity he worked in the office of the Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to organize a major conference on science, technology, and foreign policy. For his service, he was awarded the State Department&#x2032;s Superior Honor Award. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From 1981 to 1983 Nau served as a senior staff member of the National Security Council responsible for international economic affairs. He was President Reagan&#x2019;s White House aide, or Sherpa, for the annual G7 economic summits in Ottawa (1981), Versailles (1982), and Williamsburg (1983), and for the special summit with developing countries in Cancun (1982). At those summits, the United States led a revival of the world economy from the stagflation and resource shortages of the 1970s to thirty years of 3+ percent growth per year, promoting the so-called Washington Consensus (originating in the Williamsburg Summit Communique) of lower inflation, freer markets and open trade. Nau wrote an account of these early years in <i>The Myth of America&#x2019;s Decline </i>(see below).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside government, Nau continued his public service. From 1984 to 1990 he served &nbsp;on the U.S. Department of State&#x2019;s Advisory Committee on International Investment and as the U.S. member of the UN Committee for Development Planning. From 1989 to 2016, he directed the U.S.&#x2013;Japan&#x2013;South Korea Legislative Exchange Program, semiannual meetings among members of the U.S. Congress, the Japanese Diet, and the South Korean National Assembly. In 2016, the Japanese government awarded him the Order of the Rising Sun, Neck Ribbon with Gold Rays, the highest honor for academic leaders, in recognition of his work on this Exchange. From 1963 to 1965, Nau also served as a lieutenant in the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.</p><p>Nau&#x2019;s published books include, among others, <i>Conservative Internationalism: Armed Diplomacy under Jefferson, Polk, Truman, and Reagan</i> (Princeton University Press, 2013, and paperback with new preface, 2015); <i>At Home Abroad: Identity and Power in American Foreign Policy </i>(Cornell University Press, 2002); <i>Trade and Security: U.S. Policies at Cross-Purposes </i>(American Enterprise Institute, 1995); <i>The Myth of America&#x2019;s Decline: Leading the World Economy into the 1990s </i>(Oxford University Press, 1990); and <i>National Politics and International Technology: Peaceful Nuclear Reactor Development in Western Europe</i> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974).

Students find in this book the instruments to link the world of political ideas to sets of facts in international relations. Professors are reminded of their perennial scholarly duty to teach students how to assess competing worldviews to explain every aspect of international relations. In sum, this is one of the most comprehensive textbooks in our field</p> Author: Roberto Dominguez<br><br><p>Striking just the right balance in content and readership level, Professor Nau&#x2019;s <i>Perspectives on International Relations</i> has been well received in both my graduate and undergraduate seminars. The extensive application of classical and contemporary international relations theories to key global issues, core concepts and methodological problems has furthered students&#x2019; understanding and appreciation of the complexities of international relations. Moreover, Nau&#x2019;s text has served as an indispensable review for my graduate students preparing for comprehensive exams in the field</p> Author: Waltraud Morales<br><br><p>World politics is an exceedingly complex subject, and the myriad ways scholars study and teach it make it seem still more complex. More than most textbooks, Henry Nau&#x2032;s helps students by imposing some order on this complexity. The seriousness with which Nau takes history; his clear treatment of political economy as well as of international security; and above all his applications of three major schools of thought - realism, liberalism, and constructivism - make this a superb introduction</p> Author: John Owen</p><h2>The Decline of the Ancient World (General History of Europe)</h2><p>This celebrated account of the decline of the ancient world describes the fall of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the emergence of the new medieval European order.</p><p></p><h2>Jimmy&#39;s Blues: Selected Poems</h2><p>Finally in paperback, here is James Baldwin&#39;s only collection of poems. Baldwin&#39;s language is deceptively simple--this poetry is easily understood. But the emotions behind the words go to the core not only of the poet&#39;s soul, but of America&#39;s. Readers will see Baldwin here in both a familiar and an altogether different light.</p><p>To his achievements as novelist, essayist, and playwright, Baldwin adds this collection of 19 lyrics that merge intense feeling against racism and oppression with a streetwise yet visionary poetic voice. In the powerful and earthy cadences of the blues traditionthe black's tragic voicehe confronts the destructive uses of power and asks us to reassess what constitutes a just society. In place of bitterness he offers compassion, and he looks beyond the rhetoric of protest, of personal and national failure, to "the palace of wisdom." His upbeat conclusion is "Our children are/ the morning star." Frank Allen, Assoc.

Rather than trying to change anyone&#x2019;s behavior, Weisbord and Janoff show you how to change the conditions under which people interact. By doing less, you help others do more. With examples from around the world, and practical tips and exercises in every chapter, <i>Don&#x2019;t Just Do Something, Stand There!</i> gives you many new techniques for helping people discover common ground, make productive use of dissension, and take responsibility for action.</p><p>Marvin R. Weisbord is a fellow of the World Academy of Productivity Science and is the author of Organizational Diagnosis, Productive Workplaces Revisited, and Discovering Common Ground.<br> Sandra Janoff, Ph.D., is an international consultant, psychologist, and coauthor, with Marvin Weisbord, of Future Search: An Action Guide. Weisbord and Janoff are co-directors of the Future Search Network, a global volunteer service collaborative.Making Every Meeting Matter<br><br> I want to see progress . . . or it is a waste of time. But that<br> isn&#x2019;t the meeting&#x2019;s fault. That is the fault of the person calling<br> and leading the meeting.<br><br> &#x2014;DARIN HAMER, IT professional, Topeka, Kansas (2006)<br><br> Our purpose in writing this book is to help you become more effective in the world through the meetings you lead. You will have a chance to master a few simple practices to enhance whatever works for you now. You will learn to recognize procedures that no longer get results. Above all, you will come face to face with the assumptions you make about meetings. If you are going through the motions anyway, why perpetuate cynicism when you can succeed every time?<br><br> If you adopt our principles, you will become fanatical about make-or-break matters like matching participants to purposes; and you will manage the daylights out of mundane matters like time frames, rooms, and seating. You also will develop a new awareness of key factors few people notice. You&#x2019;ll pay more attention, for example, to the emergence of informal subgroups that can derail your meeting in an eye blink. You&#x2019;ll become more aware of what people expect from leaders and of the demands you make on yourself.<br><br> What you will not do is fret over people&#x2019;s motives, attitudes, and personal quirks. In other words, instead of managing other people&#x2019;s behavior, you will manage structure-the conditions under which people interact. The only individual you will seek to manage is you.<br><br> We began switching our focus from behavior to structure many years ago. Early in our careers, we noticed some recurring patterns that defeated our aspirations for engagement, outcomes, and follow-up. We found, for example, that the &#x201c;wrong people&#x201d; often were in the room. Among them they lacked the expertise, authority, or information to act. That&#x2019;s a structural phenomenon certain to alienate even those with the best intentions. People grew sick and tired of adding more meetings to their calendars. For those who had to show up anyway, we turned ourselves inside out dealing with skepticism at the expense of action. We found it easy to diagnose bad behavior. While diagnosis brings with it the heady illusion of control, most people can&#x2019;t be fixed, no matter how many prescriptions you write. People did, however, fix themselves when we changed the conditions under which they interacted.<br><br> We believe that structure becomes more critical the greater the range of differences in the room. If you treat differences as a problem crying for resolution, you undertake an anxious hunt for an elusive quarry. Differences&#x2014; few of us like them&#x2014;often divert people from doing their best. Think of difference as a fact of life you can learn to live with. Think of structure as a menu of choices you have for providing people opportunities to take responsibility.<br><br> In managing diverse groups, we realized as we crossed cultural boundaries that we could no longer diagnose individual or group needs. We had to learn how to honor differences while building on what people have in common, in particular-the indisputable validity (for every person) of their own experience.<br><br> Paradoxically, when you emphasize structure rather than behavior, you may be at your best in situations you once dreaded. You will come to see different worldviews, assumptions, and stereotypes as normal. Perhaps the most liberating discovery we have made is how to enhance a diverse group&#x2019;s capability for action by accepting rather than fixing anybody&#x2019;s shortcomings. If you train yourself to work with people the way they are, you will free yourself from endless suffering.<br><br> You will become more effective in two ways.<br><br> � First, you will pay more attention to organizing meetings based on purposes. You will discover the increased capability of those involved to reach goals they once thought unreachable.<br><br> � Second, you will develop keener instincts for when you need to shift structure and when you don&#x2019;t. As your capability grows for letting people find their own voices, so will your self-confidence in handling new situations no matter what a group chooses to do.<br><br> HOW WE CAME TO WRITE THIS BOOK<br><br> When a cat chases its tail, success always hurts more than failure. Early in our careers each of us acquired a repertoire essential to our work-for goal setting, team building, problem solving, visioning, strategic planning, conflict management, and self-awareness. We had the unusual privilege of working with many pioneers of group effectiveness. They created a rich storehouse of methods that influenced generations of practitioners.<br><br> A Legacy&#x2014;Ours and Yours<br><br> We trace our influences back to the first study ever to document the notable differences among democratic, autocratic, and laissez-faire leaders (Lewin, Lippitt, &amp; White, 1939). This research with young boys doing arts and crafts projects opened up a new vista for action that came to be called &#x201c;group dynamics.&#x201d;<br><br> The practices we advocate were inspired by Ronald Lippitt and Eric Trist, among the founders, respectively, of National Training Laboratories (NTL Institute) in the United States and The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations in Great Britain, and their collaborators Eva Schindler-Rainman and Fred Emery; John Weir (1975) and Joyce Weir, pioneers of personal growth laboratories in &#x201c;Self-Differentiation&#x201d;; Yvonne Agazarian (1997), developer of a &#x201c;Theory of Living Human Systems&#x201d; of functional subgrouping; Claes Janssen (2005), creator of the &#x201c;four-room apartment&#x201d; model of personal and group development; Paul Lawrence, who with Jay Lorsch (Lawrence &amp; Lorsch, 1967) showed how differentiation/integration theory applies to organizations; and the late Gunnar Hjelholt (Madsen &amp; Willert, 2006), a Danish social scientist who inspired us to connect meetings to larger purposes that help people transcend their differences.<br><br> To this wonderful legacy we quickly appended more techniques and variations like a cat spinning ever-faster toward its elusive goal. As the world grew more diverse and the pace of change went ballistic, we lined our bookshelves with more methods than we could use in two lifetimes. We were managing our own anxiety by creating higher hurdles, believing that the bigger the tool kit, the better carpenters we would be. By the late 1980s, we realized we would never have at our fingertips the right procedure for all the variations on culture and personal style that we ran into. Nobody could devise all-purpose hammers fast enough to bang away at the emerging multiple dilemmas of escalating complexity. The only way to exit this obstacle course was to stop chasing techniques.<br><br> Image<br><br> RETHINKING EVERYTHING<br><br> Thus, we began a transition that took some years. We decided that if the goals were too big for the people, we would not run the meeting. We began turning down requests to squeeze a day&#x2019;s worth of work into 2 hours. We pared down our repertoire to a few structural procedures nearly anybody could follow. We determined to manage meetings in such a way that people could use the experience, skills, and aspirations they already had. Thus, action would be inevitable unless people consciously chose not to act. We adopted a theory about when to jump in and when to just stand there. We committed to a philosophy based on accepting people as we found them, not as we wished them to be.<br><br> Along the way, we poured our early experiences into a strategic planning book we called Future Search (Weisbord &amp; Janoff, 2000). There we told how we dropped one by one most of the meeting procedures we once relied on. Some of our changes were heretical. We did away with hallowed concepts like conflict management and priority setting. For these we substituted common ground (agreement by all) and voting-with-your-feet (setting priorities based on willing actors rather than good ideas). We focused on dialogue&#x2014;having all views heard without needing to act on them. We became alert to those moments when people might scapegoat one another with careless comments, diverting everybody from the task.<br><br> We dropped labels like &#x201c;resistance&#x201d; and &#x201c;defensiveness,&#x201d; choosing instead to see people doing their best with what they had. We stopped listing problems as the first step, building instead toward a comprehensive picture of the whole and a preferred future before deciding what needed to be done. We stopped asking what went wrong and how to fix it. Instead, we substituted &#x201c;What are the possibilities here, and who cares?&#x201d;<br><br> Managing large groups of dozens or hundreds, we made our unit of change the capacity of the whole for action, not the satisfaction of each person&#x2019;s needs or the perfection of every small group&#x2019;s process skills. We encouraged breakout groups to self-manage, precluding the need to have them led by expert facilitators. We stopped assuming that people who said nothing supported the goals and decisions. We paid the most attention to those critical moments when groups were at risk of fragmenting, fighting, or running away.<br><br> Under these conditions, people got more done in less time and with greater satisfaction than they ever did when we tried to manage all the details ourselves. The less we did, the more others took over. They did not need to be coaxed into action or provided with complex follow-up strategies. We never tried to change anybody. What we changed were the conditions under which people met. To our surprise, the more we practiced structural change, the better people managed their relationships. Changing a meeting&#x2019;s structure, we found, was the shortcut for people wanting to change their own behavior.<br><br> LEARNING TO STAND THERE<br><br> Most of all, we changed ourselves. We let go needing to have all the answers, figure out each group&#x2019;s problems and blockages, and keep everybody happy all the time. We taught ourselves to act less and pay attention more. Ours became an alert form of &#x201c;just standing there,&#x201d; observing, listening, and inviting people to say what was on their minds without prompting them to be positive, negative, or any way except the way they chose to be.<br><br> Recently our friend Dawn Rieken gave us a wonderful description of this way of being-quiet on the outside, active inside. Active on the inside is what we are most of the time. The trick is to change the inner dialogue from anxiety to observing without having to fix everything. Instead, we rely on a theory about what it takes for people to manage themselves. Our theory, which we will get to in a moment, is our security blanket.<br><br> There are times, however, when people want to fight or flee the goals, the task, the problem, or decision. At those moments we become visibly active. We move in, saying and doing the least that will interrupt a potential fight, clarify an elusive goal, or pose a choice. In those moments, we learned, we are at our best when we can contain our own anxiety and quiet ourselves inside.<br><br> In short, when people work the task, we do nothing overt. When they put themselves at risk of fighting or running away, we calm ourselves and become as active as we need to be to get the meeting back on track.<br><br> DISCOVERING DIFFERENTIATION/ INTEGRATION THEORY<br><br> Early in our collaboration, we had a rewarding &#x201c;aha&#x201d; that made possible this book. Each of us, Sandra in education and psychology, Marv in business and organizational consulting, had relied on versions of the same structural theory. We both were applying differentiation/integration (D/I) theory to our work with students, clients, and even ourselves. This is not to say that we had the legendary &#x201c;all-purpose hammer.&#x201d; A theory is not a method. It&#x2019;s a way of interpreting reality that helps you act with more certainty. D/I theory helped us make sense of puzzling complexities in a world of increasing diversity, multiple agendas, and nonstop change. For what we aspired to do, that was quite enough.<br><br> D/I Defined<br><br> Noah Webster&#x2019;s big dictionary says that differentiating means &#x201c;to distinguish and classify&#x201d;-that is, to group similar things together. It also can mean to &#x201c;isolate, ostracize and segregate.&#x201d; Likewise, integrating has two faces. In a positive sense, it means &#x201c;to make one or harmonize&#x201d;; in the negative, &#x201c;to centralize and orchestrate.&#x201d;<br><br> To become better meeting leaders, we decided our challenge was to help people differentiate their stakes without excluding anybody and integrate their goals without our forcing unity. Moreover, we came to understand that unless people differentiate their stakes, they are unlikely to act together. Wanting harmony, wholeness, cooperation, and shared goals, we had to start by validating differences. Seeking integrated action, we could not avoid polarities. We had to learn to make them legitimate.<br><br> Key D/I Principles<br><br> D/I theory has a long history in biology, mathematics, social psychology, and developmental psychology. To begin at the beginning, D/I applies to your earliest moments on Earth. You started life as a single cell that divided and subdivided. Your cells evolved to perform different functions&#x2014;a beating heart, a thinking brain, a digestive system, each unique in purpose and structure, integrated into a one-of-a-kind working model of a human being.<br><br> The organizational analogies should be obvious. Imagine a company that exists to deliver any product or service. Its functions could include research and development, manufacturing, sales, and information systems. They are differentiated, each with its own structural needs. None can accomplish the mission alone. They are faced with a tricky D/I task: holding onto their differences and integrating toward a result bigger than any of them. They cannot afford to act in ways that deny the necessity of each.<br><br> Our job as leaders/managers/facilitators is to set things up so that people can accept their differences and integrate their capabilities for the good of all. Making the leap from &#x201c;D&#x201d; to &#x201c;I&#x201d; is at the core of effective meeting management.<br><br> Many Practical Uses<br><br> In this book, we show you some of the many practical applications of D/I theory that we have made. You can use it to understand why some systems function better than others. You can use it when you plan a meeting, figuring out who to invite and how to use &#x201c;breakout&#x201d; groups. From D/I theory, you can derive practical procedures for handling conflict, reaching decisions, and implementing action plans. The first time you apply it, you may come to appreciate key meeting dynamics that were not on your radar screen. You will learn more about when to keep quiet, when to speak, and what to say. You&#x2019;ll be able to prove to yourself that a few simple actions can keep groups working in the face of inevitable differences.<br><br> Nor is this all. From D/I theory, you will gain insight into your own potential for personal growth. You will learn to use it as a lens for your own projections, helping you contain your anxiety in new situations. You will be in a better position to avoid exchanges that &#x201c;hook&#x201d; you into responding in ways you later regret. In short, D/I theory will help you gain a new measure of influence over any system. We intend to make the journey easy and illuminating for you.<br><br> HOW THE BOOK IS ORGANIZED<br><br> This book has two parts, &#x201c;Leading Meeti...</p><h2>Elementary Algebra</h2><p>Ideal for lecture-format courses taught at the post-secondary level, ELEMENTARY ALGEBRA, Ninth Edition, makes algebra accessible and engaging.

While popular memory of the Vietnam War centers on the &#34;combat moment,&#34; refocusing attention onto women and gender paints a more complex and accurate picture of the war&#39;s far-reaching impact beyond the battlefields. Encounters between Americans and Vietnamese were shaped by a cluster of intertwined images used to make sense of and justify American intervention and use of force in Vietnam. These images included the girl next door, a wholesome reminder of why the United States was committed to defeating Communism; the treacherous and mysterious &#34;dragon lady,&#34; who served as a metaphor for Vietnamese women and South Vietnam; the John Wayne figure, entrusted with the duty of protecting civilization from savagery; and the gentle warrior, whose humanitarian efforts were intended to win the favor of the South Vietnamese. Heather Stur also examines the ways in which ideas about masculinity shaped the American GI experience in Vietnam and, ultimately, how some American men and women returned from Vietnam to challenge homefront gender norms.</p><p>This book illuminates the crucial role the Vietnam War played in influencing gender roles in America. Encounters between Americans and Vietnamese were shaped by images the U.S. military, policymakers, and popular culture used to make sense of and justify American intervention and use of force in Vietnam. Heather Stur examines the ways in which ideas about masculinity shaped the American GI experience in Vietnam and, ultimately, how some American men and women returned from Vietnam to challenge home front gender norms.Heather Marie Stur is an Assistant Professor of History at the University of Southern Mississippi, a fellow in USM&#39;s Center for the Study of War and Society, and director of USM&#39;s Vietnam Studies program.

Concentrated at first in the Near East but spreading rapidly westward, spirit possession, both benevolent and malevolent, emerged as perhaps the most characteristic form of religiosity in early modern Jewish society.</p><p>Adopting a comparative historical approach, J. H. Chajes uncovers this strain of Jewish belief to which scant attention has been paid. Informed by recent research in historical anthropology, Between Worlds provides fascinating descriptions of the cases of possession as well as analysis of the magical techniques deployed by rabbinic exorcists to expel the ghostly intruders.</p><p>Seeking to understand the phenomenon of spirit possession in its full complexity, Chajes delves into its ideational framework&#x2014;chiefly the doctrine of reincarnation&#x2014;while exploring its relation to contemporary Christian and Islamic analogues. Regarding spirit possession as a form of religious expression open to&#x2014;and even dominated by&#x2014;women, Chajes initiates a major reassessment of women in the history of Jewish mysticism. In a concluding section he examines the reception history of the great Hebrew accounts of spirit possession, focusing on the deployment of these "ghost stories" in the battle against incipient skepticism in the turbulent Jewish community of seventeenth-century Amsterdam.</p><p>Exploring a phenomenon that bridged learned and ignorant, rich and poor, men and women, Jews and Gentiles, Between Worlds maps for the first time a prominent feature of the early modern Jewish religious landscape, as quotidian as it was portentous: the nexus of the living and the dead.</p></p><p>J. H. Chajes teaches Jewish history at the University of Haifa.<p>"This is a major contribution, not only to early modern Jewish studies but to the subject of spirit possession broadly conceived in the Christian world."&#x2014;Edward Peters, University of Pennsylvania</p><br><br><p>"Chajes's excellent new book . . . succeeds in demystifying the subject of Jewish spirit (i.e., "dybbuk") possession by placing it within a broader cross-cultural and historical context, a s sophisticated methodological approach he calls a 'historical anthropology of spirit possession.' . . . His work is both a history and a phenomenology of Jewish spirit possession during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i></p><br><br><p>"An exciting, persuasive, and well-written study and another key addition to a subject central to early modern religions."&#x2014;<i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i></p></p><h2>A Brief History of Creation: Science and the Search for the Origin of Life</h2><p><p><strong>The epic story of the scientists through the ages who have sought answers to life&#x2019;s biggest mystery: How did it begin?</strong></p><p>How did life begin?</p><p>It is perhaps the most important question science has ever asked. Over the centuries, the search for an answer has been entwined with some of science&#x2019;s most revolutionary advances including van Leeuwenhoek&#x2019;s microscope, Darwin&#x2019;s theory of evolution, and Crick and Watson&#x2019;s unveiling of DNA. Now, in an age of genetic engineering and space exploration, some scientists believe they are on the verge of creating life from nonliving elements and that our knowledge of the potential for life on other planets is ever-expanding. In the midst of these exciting developments, <em>A Brief History of Creation</em> provides an essential and illuminating history of Western science, tracing the trials and triumphs of the iconoclastic scientists who have sought to uncover the mystery of how life first came to be.</p><p>Authors Bill Mesler and H. James Cleaves II examine historical discoveries in the context of philosophical debates, political change, and our evolving understanding of the complexity of biology. The story they tell is rooted in metaphysical arguments, in a changing understanding of the age of the Earth, and even in the politics of the Cold War. It has involved exploration into the inner recesses of our cells and scientific journeys to the farthest reaches of outer space. This elegantly written narrative culminates in an analysis of modern models for life&#x2019;s genesis, such as the possibility that some of the earliest life was composed of little more than RNA, and that life arose around deep-sea hydrothermal vents or even on other planets, only to be carried to the Earth on meteorites.</p><p>Can we ever conclusively prove how life began? <em>A Brief History of Creation</em> is a fascinating exploration not only of the origin-of-life question but of the very nature of scientific objectivity and the process of scientific discovery.</p> 15 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Bill Mesler</strong> is a journalist who lives in Washington, DC.</p><p><strong>H. James Cleaves II</strong> is vice president of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, a professor at the Earth-Life Science Institute in Tokyo, and a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He lives in Washington, DC.</p>"An absorbing account... reveals as much about the process of science as it does about the puzzle of life.&nbsp; That's no mean achievement."&nbsp;(John Farrell, Wall Street Journal)<br><br>"Mesler&nbsp;and Cleaves fill their story with petty rivalries, stubborn refusal to acknowledge facts, u-turns in theory, dead ends, eureka moments and more... this is popular history of the first order." (Michael Glitz, Huffington Post)</p><h2>Viruses: A Scientific American Library Book</h2><p>Since the isolation of the first virus in 1892 scientists have made tremendous advances by asking one question at a time and building on the answers. Dr. Levine celebrates the successes that have come from viral studies - the development of a wide range of vaccines, the eradication of smallpox, and the insights into the origins of cancer. He also examines the challenges we still face, with a series of interconnected chapters on the specific viruses behind some of our most urgent public health problems, including the viruses that cause AIDS, influenza, herpes and hepatitis. A concluding chapter on the origin and evolution of viruses touches on some of the most provocative issues in molecular biology today. Viral infections continue to be an immediate health concern of imposing proportions. &#34;Viruses&#34; is written for the general reader eager to know how we study and confront these diseases and where today&#39;s research may lead.</p><p></p><h2>The Art of Being Human (11th Edition)</h2><p><i>For courses in Introduction to Humanities</i> <br> <br> <b>Help students broaden their perspectives and enrich their lives through the humanities</b> <br> <i> <b>The Art of Being Human: The Humanities as a Technique for Living </b> </i>introduces students to the joys of the humanities &#x2014; those disciplines that reflect the best efforts of human culture through the ages and around the globe.

It offers a guide to practical action which verges on mysticism: how to exercise strength without needing to be strong, how to win by yielding. Lao-Tze's exhortation to act while not-acting or 'doing nothing' has astonished and fascinated Chinese and Westerners alike.</p></p><p>Text: English, Chinese</p><h2>Peshat and Derash: Plain and Applied Meaning in Rabbinic Exegesis</h2><p>From the days of Plato, the problem of the efficacy and adequacy of the written word as a vehicle of human communication has challenged mankind, yet the mystery of how best to achieve clarity and exactitude of written expression has never been solved. The most repercussive instance of this universal problem has been the exegesis of the law embodied in Hebrew scripture. <em>Peshat and Derash</em> is the first book to trace the Jewish interpretative enterprise from a historical perspective. Applying his vast knowledge of Rabbinic materials to the long history of Jewish exegesis of both Bible and Talmud, Halivni investigates the tension that has often existed between the plain sense of the divine text (<em>peshat</em>) and its creative, Rabbinic interpretations (<em>derash</em>). Halivni addresses the theological implications of the deviation of <em>derash</em> from <em>peshat</em> and explores the differences between the ideological extreme of the religious right, which denies that Judaism has a history, and the religious left, which claims that history is all that Judaism has. A comprehensive and critical narration of the history and repercussions of Rabbinic exegesis, this analysis will interest students of legal texts, hermeneutics, and scriptural traditions, as well as anyone involved in Jewish studies.</p><p>David Weiss Halivni, Professor of Religious Studies, Columbia University.<br>"[Halivni] is one of the few scholars in the world who has the scope of Jewish erudition to be able to survey two thousand years of exegesis--of both biblical and rabbinic texts--and draw conclusions about patterns of development....Fascinating, erudite, and controversial. It deserves to be read by all scholars and by all Jews who find the tensions between peshat and derash worthy of consideration."--<em>Hebrew Studies</em><p></p><br>"This reviewer is awed by Professor Weiss Halivni's learning and originality, and would rise in his presence as one stands before a Torah scholar....Only a great man and mind could write such a provocative work which stimulates thought and learning."--<em>The National</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, 1859-2009</h2><p>With 16.3 million members and 44,000 churches, the Southern Baptist Convention is the largest Baptist group in the world, and the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. Unlike the so-called mainstream Protestant denominations, Southern Baptists have remained stubbornly conservative, refusing to adapt their beliefs and practices to modernity's individualist and populist values. Instead, they have held fast to traditional orthodoxy in such fundamental areas as biblical inspiration, creation, conversion, and miracles. Gregory Wills argues that Southern Baptist Theological Seminary has played a fundamental role in the persistence of conservatism, not entirely intentionally. Tracing the history of the seminary from the beginning to the present, Wills shows how its foundational commitment to preserving orthodoxy was implanted in denominational memory in ways that strengthened the denomination's conservatism and limited the seminary's ability to stray from it. In a set of circumstances in which the seminary played a central part, Southern Baptists' populist values bolstered traditional orthodoxy rather than diminishing it. In the end, says Wills, their populism privileged orthodoxy over individualism. The story of Southern Seminary is fundamental to understanding Southern Baptist controversy and identity. Wills's study sheds important new light on the denomination that has played - and continues to play - such a central role in our national history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gregory A. Wills</strong> is Professor of Church History at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary.<br>This magisterial saga reads almost like a novel ... But the book&#39;s primary strength is outstanding historiography ...

This step-by-step guide is filled with self-tests, questions and answers, journaling and role playing exercises, and practical resources that give parents the insight they need to understand eating disorders and their treatment, recognize symptoms in their child, and work with their child toward recovery. This excellent and effective resource is one therapists can feel confident about recommending to patients.</p><p>Never before available to parents, When Your Child Has an Eating Disorder provides information based on the assumption that parents are NOT to blame for their child's eating disorder, but that they DO have a powerful role to play as mentors to their child's recovery. In my experience, I have found that for the most part, parents want to do what is best for their child; they deserve to be taught how by their child's treating professionals. <p>Children, throughout their childhood, teenage and young adult years continue to require the wise and informed input, support, and counsel of their parents, particularly in times of crisis or illness. Scientific research corroborates my clinical findings that family involvement in the treatment process is the most effective way to heal youngsters living at home where the processes of disease and recovery unfold on a daily basis in kitchens and bathrooms. If parents are not part of the solution, they are in danger of becoming part of the problem. </p><p>When eating disorders are detected early and treated properly, they are curable in 80% of cases. Recovered individuals, no longer victims of food and fear, cease to be victims of circumstance, of self, and of others. "Eating disorder recovery allows both parents and child to take back control of their lives and destinies."</p>Work together toward recovery <p>"When Your Child Has an Eating Disorder provides parents with hope as well as direction to aid their eating disordered child." &#x2014;Vivian Hanson Meehan, president and founder, National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders</p> <p>"This book provides parents with invaluable information about eating disorders and concrete steps to take in pursuing the best treatment option for their child. It is a much needed endorsement of the positive role families can play in treatment." &#x2014;Daniel le Grange, director, Eating Disorders Program, The University of Chicago</p> <p>"Practical, informed, comprehensive, and highly readable. This is a book that will be equally valuable to parents, patients, and clinicians." &#x2014;Craig Johnson, director, Eating Disorders Program, Laureate Psychiatric Hospital, Tulsa</p> <p>"The wonderful workbook format will help families gain a deeper and more personal understanding of the illness and assist them in developing commonsense interventions." &#x2014;Patricia Santucci, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry, Loyola Stritch School of Medicine and founding member, Academy for Eating Disorders</p> <p>Dear Parent,<br> Eating disorders know no boundaries. With indiscriminate cruelty they can crush friendships, splinter families, and ravage health. I have watched my husband, and then my daughter, in the grips of this puzzling affliction. Like a small ship lost on a thundering sea, a person who is witness to a family member's eating disorder can be overcome by fear, discouragement, or grief. For me, Abigail Natenshon's book has been like a lighthouse in that storm.<br> With knowledge that comes from experience, she guides us on this difficult journey with skill and courageous optimism. She increases our knowledge, teaches us about treatment options, and arms us with the tools to be the best advocates we can be for our child. She invites us all to look beyond the symptoms of this disease to see what's at its core-the suffering in the heart of our loved one. She reminds us that this disease can, and usually is, conquered. Your child can recover from this illness, as did mine. The ship you share can arrive safely to shore. &#x2014;With understanding and best wishes for you and your child, An Anonymous Parent</p></p><h2>Riotous Flesh: Women, Physiology, and the Solitary Vice in Nineteenth-Century America (American Beginnings, 1500-1900)</h2><p><p>Nineteenth-century America saw numerous campaigns against masturbation, which was said to cause illness, insanity, and even death. <i>Riotous Flesh</i> explores women&#x2019;s leadership of those movements, with a specific focus on their rhetorical, social, and political effects, showing how a desire to transform the politics of sex created unexpected alliances between groups that otherwise had very different goals.<br> <br> As April R. Haynes shows, the crusade against female masturbation was rooted in a generally shared agreement on some major points: that girls and women were as susceptible to masturbation as boys and men; that &#x201c;self-abuse&#x201d; was rooted in a lack of sexual information; and that sex education could empower women and girls to master their own bodies. Yet the groups who made this education their goal ranged widely, from &#x201c;ultra&#x201d; utopians and nascent feminists to black abolitionists. <i>Riotous Flesh</i> explains how and why diverse women came together to popularize, then institutionalize, the condemnation of masturbation, well before the advent of sexology or the professionalization of medicine.</p></p><p><b>April R. Haynes</b> is assistant professor of history at the University of Wisconsin&#x2013;Madison.&#x201c;Haynes&#x2019;s compelling argument will change the way scholars think, write, and teach about the moral reform movement, antislavery movement, and female sexuality in the nineteenth century. The book is deeply original, persuasive, and rich, and readers will discover something new with each encounter. <i>Riotous Flesh</i> is a revelation.&#x201d; (Carol Faulkner <i>author of Lucretia Mott&#x2019;s Heresy: Abolition and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Haynes has written one of those rare books that provokes me to reinterpret much of what I once understood about antebellum sexual reform. And by thoroughly integrating race into her analysis of sex and gender, <i>Riotous Flesh </i>makes for a compelling and courageous rewrite of nineteenth-century reform. It is also replete with memorable stories dug laboriously out of the archives and honed into well-placed narrative diamonds.&#x201d; (Stephen Nissenbaum <i>author of Sex, Diet, and Debility in Jacksonian America</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Haynes&#x2019; magnificent <i>Riotous Flesh</i> shows that in 19th-century America&#x2014;despite the taboo of female sexuality&#x2014;it was a concern with women&#x2019;s bodies that lay at the heart of anti-masturbation campaigns. . . . Turning to the history of physiology, it puts women centre stage as it explores how, why and to what effect diverse female reformers, abolitionists and educators spoke publicly about the solitary vice.<i> Riotous Flesh</i> is a treasure trove of historical insight.&#x201d; (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Haynes&#x2019;s book is a rare treat: an important contribution to the interwoven histories of white and black women, antislavery reform, medicine, and sexuality that is well-researched, clearly-argued, and beautifully written.&nbsp;It will greatly enrich scholars&#x2019; and students&#x2019; conversation about the possibilities of imagining a feminist sexuality in particular contexts of power.&nbsp;And although one struggles&#x2014;with a nod to her topic&#x2014;to exercise appropriate restraint, it is worth acknowledging that reading, and engaging, with <i>Riotous Flesh</i> is also great fun.&#x201d; (Lori D. Ginzberg <i>author of Elizabeth Cady Stanton: An American Life</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Haynes is a discerning researcher, a brilliant interpreter of historical evidence, and a gifted writer. Focusing on a topic still often taboo, <i>Riotous Flesh</i> brings together the histories of sexuality, medicalization, and race in the United States and presents a multifaceted and intricate history that is dazzlingly fresh and revelatory. <i>Riotous Flesh</i> will change not only the way we think about black and white women&#x2019;s sexuality but how we understand the political culture of nineteenth-century America.&#x201d; (Elizabeth Reis <i>author of Bodies in Doubt: An American History of Intersex</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Riotous Flesh </i>sets&nbsp;a new standard for how to study together black and white female reformers while ultimately recognizing how their ideas, tactics, and the resulting consequences necessarily diverged. Haynes has produced a work of lasting influence that is distinguished for its novel and exacting research, brilliant analysis, sharp and engaging prose, and a keenly perceptive eye for historiographic debate.&#x201d; (<i>James Broussard Prize Committee, SHEAR</i>)<br><br><i>"Riotous Flesh</i> is deeply researched. . .It is a learned interrogation of the history of the body and its role in antebellum reform politics and a must-read for historians of women, gender, sexuality, and race in the United States."

Service providers, bureaucrats, and employers exhort them to be self-reliant, individualistic, and free, even as the system and the culture constrain them within terms of ethnicity, race, and class. Buddha Is Hiding tells the story of Cambodian Americans experiencing American citizenship from the bottom-up. Based on extensive fieldwork in Oakland and San Francisco, the study puts a human face on how American institutions&#x2015;of health, welfare, law, police, church, and industry&#x2015;affect minority citizens as they negotiate American culture and re-interpret the American dream.<br><br>In her earlier book, <i>Flexible Citizenship, </i>anthropologist Aihwa Ong wrote of elite Asians shuttling across the Pacific. This parallel study tells the very different story of "the other Asians" whose route takes them from refugee camps to California's inner-city and high-tech enclaves. In <i>Buddha Is Hiding </i>we see these refugees becoming new citizen-subjects through a dual process of being-made and self-making, balancing religious salvation and entrepreneurial values as they endure and undermine, absorb and deflect conflicting lessons about welfare, work, medicine, gender, parenting, and mass culture. Trying to hold on to the values of family and home culture, Cambodian Americans nonetheless often feel that "Buddha is hiding." Tracing the entangled paths of poor and rich Asians in the American nation, Ong raises new questions about the form and meaning of citizenship in an era of globalization.</p><p>"In this tour-de-force ethnography, acclaimed anthropologist Aihwa Ong trains her awesome ethnographic and theoretic talents on the brutal forces reconfiguring citizenship in a globalized world of war refugees, economic immigrants, and technicians of the modern soul.

In a wide range of literatures and mythologies such intimate aggression is a source of ultimate terror, and in <i>Witchcraft, Intimacy, and Trust</i>, Peter Geschiere masterfully sketches it as a central ember at the core of human relationships, one brutally revealed in the practice of witchcraft. Examining witchcraft in its variety of forms throughout the globe, he shows how this often misunderstood practice is deeply structured by intimacy and the powers it affords. In doing so, he offers not only a comprehensive look at contemporary witchcraft but also a fresh&#x2014;if troubling&#x2014;new way to think about intimacy itself. <br> <br> Geschiere begins in the forests of southeast Cameroon with the Maka, who fear &#x201c;witchcraft of the house&#x201d; above all else. Drawing a variety of local conceptions of intimacy into a global arc, he tracks notions of the home and family&#x2014;and witchcraft&#x2019;s transgression of them&#x2014;throughout Africa, Europe, Brazil, and Oceania, showing that witchcraft provides powerful ways of addressing issues that are crucial to social relationships. Indeed, by uncovering the link between intimacy and witchcraft in so many parts of the world, he paints a provocative picture of human sociality that scrutinizes some of the most prevalent views held by contemporary social science.<br> <br> One of the few books to situate witchcraft in a global context, <i>Witchcraft, Intimacy, and Trust</i> is at once a theoretical tour de force and an empirically rich and lucid take on a difficult-to-understand spiritual practice and the private spaces throughout the world it so greatly affects. </p></p><p><p><b>Peter Geschiere</b> is professor of African anthropology at the University of Amsterdam and the author of <i>The Modernity of Witchcraft: Politics and the Occult in Postcolonial Africa</i>.</p>&#x201c;Geschiere provides a new understanding of witchcraft and valuable keys that help to explain the persistence of the occult in contemporary Africa and elsewhere. . . .

Leykam <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Witchcraft&#x2014;as a theme&#x2014;always risks carrying a sort of pejorative or even racist undercurrent of meaning: it cannot help but evoke the backward, the irrational, the pre-political. This began to change in the 1990s, owing in large part to the work of Peter Geschiere, whose book <i>The Modernity of Witchcraft</i> showed that concepts of the occult are dynamic and changing instead of static and timeless, and that they bear directly on people&#x2019;s experiences of capitalism, politics, and the state. In his newest book Geschiere takes this project a step further, setting out to show that the anxieties that many Africans express through the idiom of witchcraft are not at all unique or &#x2018;other.&#x2019; Once we strip away the trope it becomes clear that witchcraft hinges on a rather general human experience: the disturbing realisation that intimacy is always intrinsically dangerous&#x2014;that the most threatening aggression comes from within families and among neighbours.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Journal of Modern African Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Witchcraft, Intimacy and Trust: Africa in Comparison</i> is a great read in which Geschiere manages to de-exoticise the notion of witchcraft and show its universal dimension. In his search for answers, he poses many fascinating questions that open up new areas for research on the topic.&#x201d;<br> (<i>Social Anthropology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Just when we thought there was little more anthropologists had to say about witchcraft and sorcery, Peter Geschiere has uncannily done it again.

But we now live in what President Obama has called "an age without surrender ceremonies," where it is no longer easy to distinguish between times of war and times of peace.<br><br>In this inventive meditation on war, time, and the law, Mary Dudziak argues that wartime is not as discrete a time period as we like to think. Instead, America has been engaged in some form of ongoing overseas armed conflict for over a century. Meanwhile policy makers and the American public continue to view wars as exceptional events that eventually give way to normal peace times. This has two consequences: first, because war is thought to be exceptional, "wartime" remains a shorthand argument justifying extreme actions like torture and detention without trial; and second, ongoing warfare is enabled by the inattention of the American people. More disconnected than ever from the wars their nation is fighting, public disengagement leaves us without political restraints on the exercise of American war powers.<br></p><p><br><b>Mary L. Dudziak</b> is Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Law at Emory University Law School.

Yet is the nation itself 'at war'? In this timely and provocative book, Mary Dudziak shows why this question has become so difficult to answer--and warns of the dangers inherent in our failure to do so." --Andrew J . Bacevich, author of <em>Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War</em><p></p><br>"<em>War Time</em> turns our notions of both 'war' and 'time' upside down. This thought-provoking book forces us to realize that war is not an exception to 'normal' peacetime, but rather that wartime has become the norm. The implications of perpetual wartime are profound, for law, politics, and daily life. Mary Dudziak has again brought her keen cultural, historical and legal insights to bear on a subject of critical importance."--Elaine Tyler May, Regents Professor, University of Minnesota <br><p></p><br>"Taking law as her focal point but ranging much more widely, Mary Dudziak's provocative meditation on what we mean in speaking of a 'time' of war invites readers to reflect on how we think about war itself. It should change our understanding of what-and when-war 'is' for Americans."--Mark Tushnet, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law, Harvard Law School<p></p><br>"<em>War Time</em> is one of those rare books that can entirely reorient how one thinks about the world. By showing the reader what Americans have meant-and have come to mean-by 'wartime,' Mary Dudziak shows us assumptions about war and peace that govern political and legal thought without anyone noticing. This is an intellectual tour de force, and beautifully written to boot."--H. Jefferson Powell , George Washington Law School<p></p><br>"[T]his is a book well worth reading."--<em>New York Journal of Books</em><p></p><br>"A slim and engaging volume, wonderfully written and carefully wrought, <em>War Time</em> is a fascinating meditation on the perils of clinging to a myth of national identity that increasingly bears only a glancing resemblance to modern life."--<em>H-Diplo</em><p></p><br>"Mary Dudziak's new book, <em>War Time: An Idea, Its History, Its Consequences</em>, is a crucial document. Her smooth foray into legal and political history reveals that in not just the past decade but the past century, wartime has become a more or less permanent feature of the American experience, though we fail to recognize it....Dudziak assembles an intellectual Rubik's Cube, playing with ideas of time, law, killing and politics, and arranging them into a pattern that all but eliminates the distinctions we long assumed to have existed between war and peace."--<em>The Nation</em><p></p><br>"Humanists will regard much Dudziak's text as an anecdotally rich and sprightly written reestablishment of the threshold claim that culture and society affect temporal categories and experience....For humans, at least, individual and collective experience is not that of the clock ticking equivalent seconds but the packaging of meaning through temporal definition. 'Wartime,' Dudziak can therefore add, is not an objective fact about history but a fashion of assigning significance with its own cultural style and political implications. Dudziak reveals and exploits this truth beautifully."--Lawfare.com<p></p><br>"Drawing thoughtfully from the literature of legal studies, political science, history and sociology, Dudziak crafts a fascinating and nuanced narrative tracing the progressive expansion of U.S. national security interests and the complex ramifications."--<em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"This is an intriguing little book...[A] thoughtful and original take on the concept of war."--<em>Foreign Affairs</em><br><p></p><br>"This is an important book...It has the potential to reshape how we interpret post-1945 American History."--<em>Journal of American History</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Exceptional America: What Divides Americans from the World and from Each Other</h2><p>Why did Donald Trump follow Barack Obama into the White House? Why is America in an age of polarization? And how does American exceptionalism explain these social changes?<br> &nbsp;<br> In this provocative book, Mugambi Jouet describes why Americans are far more polarized than other Westerners over basic issues, including wealth inequality, health care, climate change, evolution, gender roles, abortion, gay rights, sex, gun control, mass incarceration, the death penalty, torture, human rights, and war. Raised in Paris by a French mother and Kenyan father, Jouet then lived in the Bible Belt, Manhattan, and beyond. Drawing inspiration from Alexis de Tocqueville, he wields his multicultural sensibility to parse how the intense polarization of U.S. conservatives and liberals has become a key dimension of American exceptionalism - an idea widely misunderstood as American superiority. While exceptionalism once was a source of strength, it may now spell decline, as unique features of U.S. history, politics, law, culture, religion, and race relations foster grave conflicts. They also shed light on the intriguing ideological evolution of American conservatism, which long predated Trumpism. Anti-intellectualism, conspiracy-mongering, a visceral suspicion of government, and Christian fundamentalism are far more common in America than the rest of the Western world - Europe, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. <i>Exceptional America&nbsp;</i>dissects the American soul, in all of its peculiar,&nbsp;clashing, and striking manifestations.</p><p>&#x201c;America is exceptional, just not in the way most conservatives think. What makes us exceptional, argues Mugambi Jouet in this engaging and learned book,&nbsp;is precisely the degree to which American conservatives reject ideas that are well-accepted in the rest of the Western world and instead embrace punitive criminal justice policies, fundamentalist religious beliefs, and an anti-intellectualism that rejects established findings ranging from global warming to biological evolution. Seeking to understand rather than condemn, Jouet offers a rich and revealing portrait of the America that produced President Donald J. Trump.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Jacob S.&nbsp;Hacker, Professor of Political Science and Director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies, Yale University&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;This thought-provoking work explores a political shift that has transformed the concept of American exceptionalism into one of American superiority. The author, raised in Paris by a French mother and a Kenyan father and a graduate of American universities, brings the invaluable perspective of an insider-outsider to the double-edged impact of exceptionalist ideology on both the United States and the world. With a combination of appreciation and skepticism, he recognizes the positive exceptionalism of America as a 'city on a hill' as well as a negative insularity that has made the United States an outlier among Western democracies on issues ranging from capital punishment to international human rights treaties.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Susan Jacoby, bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Age of American Unreason</i><br><br> &#x201c;This book is so necessary today. Mugambi Jouet analyzes how the rise of mass incarceration is a microcosm of American society&#x2019;s larger evolution in the past thirty years. This insightful and powerful book, coming from a remarkable comparative perspective, shows well how American attitudes toward criminal justice, health care, economics, race, religion, gender, human rights, and other key issues are more interrelated than we realize.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Bernard Harcourt, Professor of Law and Director of the Center for Contemporary Critical Thought, Columbia Law School&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;The election of Donald Trump, writes Mugambi Jouet, was not an exceptional departure from American ways of thinking. Rather, the intensifying conservatism that produced it is exceptional when compared to other Western democracies and to America's own asserted values of liberty, equality, and justice. From a multidisciplinary and global perspective, Jouet brilliantly dissects the historical, political, and ideological reasons why Americans are so polarized from other nations and from each other.&nbsp;Exceptional America&nbsp;sheds fresh light on the peculiar and alarming state of U.S. politics today.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Dorothy Roberts, Professor of Law and Sociology, University of Pennsylvania, and author of&nbsp;Fatal Invention: How Science, Politics, and Big Business Re-create Race in the Twenty-first Century.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;Mugambi Jouet traveled from Paris, France, to Houston, Texas, as a college freshman and has been trying to make sense of the American experience ever since.

Does it have rhyme or meter? How did ancient Hebrew writers compose their works? James Kugel's provocative study provides surprising new answers to these age-old questions. Biblical "poetry" is not a concept native to the Bible itself, he proposes, and the idea that the Bible is divided into prose and verse is merely an approximation of the reality of biblical style. Arguing that the Bible presents a continuum of speech heightened in varying degrees by different means, Kugel sets out to describe Hebrew's high style on its own terms. He also offers a thorough history of the idea of biblical poetry, starting with Philo of Alexandria and Josephus in the first century C.E. and charting its development through the Church Fathers, medieval Jewish writers, the Christian Hebraists of the Renaissance, and on into modern times. The story of how each age understood the nature biblical poetry, Kugel concludes, is a key to understanding the Bible's place in the history of Western thought.</p></p><p><p><b>James Kugel </b> is the Starr Professor of Hebrew Literature at Harvard University and Professor of Bible at Bar Ilan University, Israel.

The second volume, I Am, focused on two crucial aspects of the escape from being a mere organism: selfhood and agency. This, the final volume in the trilogy, argues that knowledge is unique to human beings and sufficiently important to call man 'the knowing animal'.Raymond Tallis examines the profound difference between knowledge 'That things are the case' and mere sentience. He criticises both accounts of knowledge that marginalise the consciousness of the knower and naturalistic accounts that assimilate knowledge to sense experience and, ultimately, neural activity. He argues that knowledge arises because humans are embodied subjects and not just organisms: knowing subjects know both about events in the material world which they can perceive as well as non-material 'facts'.

Keller received her PhD in biophysical chemistry from the University of New Mexico in 1992. She was then awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of New Mexico, followed by a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. As Dr. Keller home schooled her three children, she was unable to find science textbooks that she felt would give her children a solid foundation in the sciences. Her scientific background, coupled with her desire to educate her children, led Dr. Keller to found Gravitas Publications, Inc. and to develop the Real Science-4-Kids curriculum. Real Science-4-Kids is a &#x201c;worldview-neutral&#x201d; curriculum that provides students with a solid foundation in the sciences and also gives them the tools to evaluate scientific data on their own. Students are presented with up-to-date scientific facts and the steps of the scientific method, together with the critical thinking tools needed to help them evaluate scientific conclusions. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s books are as philosophically neutral as possible and do not impose any single overall philosophical interpretation such as Darwinism, Intelligent Design, or Creationism. Instead, they allow students to make up their own minds about what the data show. Real Science-4-Kids, with its engaging, kid-friendly text and easy to use teacher-friendly manuals, is used in home, private, and public schools in all 50 states in the US and in many other countries. Dr. Keller&#x2019;s publishing team continues to develop and test products at her Albuquerque headquarters.

Must reading.&#x201d; &#x2014;Philip Lemmons, editor-in-chief, BYTE Magazine</p><p>In the early 1970s, while Silicon Valley was designing the latest generation of digital wristwatches and pocket calculators, a ragtag group of college dropouts, hippies, and electronics hobbyists were busy creating the future in their garages. What they built was the personal computer, but what they were aiming for was something much more ambitious: a revolution. <i>Fire in the Valley</i> is the story of their efforts, and in particular, the contributions of an informal think tank called the Homebrew Computer Club. Its technically gifted community, comprising sci-fi aficionados and Berkeley counterculturists, believed computers could usher in an age of human empowerment, perhaps even a utopia.<p> The club's most famous member is Steve Jobs of Apple, whose story is told here, as is Bill Gates's, who was strongly influenced by Homebrew. What sets <i>Fire in the Valley</i> apart from the many other books about early days at Apple and Microsoft, though, is its focus on the brilliant engineers and coders who built the foundation that would eventually support those two companies. They included ex-<i>Berkley Barb</i> editor and hardware designer Lee Felsenstein, who was adamant about using computers for populist ends; Adam Osborne, who took PCs to the next level by making them portable; hacker legend John "Captain Crunch" Draper, who used telephony for his own mischievous purposes; and activist Ted Nelson, the Thom Paine of the computer revolution.</p><p> The cast of characters is sometimes tough to keep track of, and authors Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine have wisely included a graphic timeline in the first pages of the book that readers will find useful. It stretches from 1800 to 1999, encompassing events that have occurred since <i>Fire in the Valley</i>'s original 1984 publication. This second edition includes new chapters and photographs to document the last 15 years, but they serve as more of an epilogue than a new act in this drama. The Homebrew Club's mark on personal computing history is cemented, and <i>Fire in the Valley</i> is an engaging account of it, one that should inspire readers everywhere. <i>--Demian McLean</i></p>In the early 1970s the personal computer was just a wild dream shared by a small group of computer enthusiasts in an area south of San Francisco now called Silicon Valley. <p>Working after-hours in basements and warehouses, computer pioneers Jobs and Wozniak of Apple Computer, Gates of Microsoft, Kildall of Digital Research, and many others ignited a technological revolution of astounding magnitude.</p> <p>This is the story of those individuals and the industry they founded. It reveals the visions they shared, the sacrifices they made, and the rewards they reaped. A fascinating account of an idea that caught fire.</p> <p>&#x201c;Swaine and Freiberger capture the communal spirit of the early computer clubs, the brilliance and blundering of some of the first start-up companies, the assortment of naivete, noble purpose and greed that characterized various pioneers, and the inevitable transformation of all this into a major industry.

Was it all a dream? In the world of Christopher Nolan's four-time Academy Award-winning movie, people can share one another's dreams and alter their beliefs and thoughts. <i>Inception</i> is a metaphysical heist film that raises more questions than it answers: Can we know what is real? Can you be held morally responsible for what you do in dreams? What is the nature of dreams, and what do they tell us about the boundaries of "self" and "other"? From Plato to Aristotle and from Descartes to Hume, <i>Inception and Philosophy</i> draws from important philosophical minds to shed new light on the movie's captivating themes, including the one that everyone talks about: did the top fall down (and does it even matter)?</p> <ul> <li>Explores the movie's key questions and themes, including how we can tell if we're dreaming or awake, how to make sense of a paradox, and whether or not inception is possible</li> <li>Gives new insights into the nature of free will, time, dreams, and the unconscious mind</li> <li>Discusses different interpretations of the film, and whether or not philosophy can help shed light on which is the "right one"</li> <li>Deepens your understanding of the movie's multi-layered plot and dream-infiltrating characters, including Dom Cobb, Arthur, Mal, Ariadne, Eames, Saito, and Yusuf</li> </ul> <p>An essential companion for every dedicated Inception fan, this book will enrich your experience of the <i>Inception</i> universe and its complex dreamscape.</p></p><p><p><b>Did the top fall?</b><br> <b>Was the whole movie just a dream?</b><br> <b>Is it possible for us to know what is truly real?</b><br> <b>When should we take our own leap of faith?</b><br> <b>Is paradox possible?</b> </p><p>In the complex world of Christopher Nolan's four-time Academy Award-winning metaphysical heist film, Inception, Dom Cobb has the ability to infiltrate people's dreams to steal and even alter their belief s and thoughts. Lurking behind these acts of extraction and inception are profound moral and philosophical issues. From Plato to Aristotle, from Descartes to Hume, Inception and Philosophy draws from the greatest philosophical minds to shed new light on the movie's key questions and captivating themes. Can we tell whether we are dreaming or awake? Is inception possible? Can sense be made of paradox? And the one that everyone still talks about: did the top fall-or does it even matter? You'll also deepen your understanding of the movie's multilayered plot and dream-crashing characters, examine different interpretations of the film, and discover whether or not philosophy can help determine which interpretation is the "right" one.

Soldiers, movie stars, and politicians gathered at her home to socialize, to show their dedication to the Allied cause, and to express their affection for Dr. Margaret Chung (1889-1959). The first known American-born Chinese female physician, Chung established one of the first Western medical clinics in San Francisco's Chinatown in the 1920s. She also became a prominent celebrity and behind-the-scenes political broker during World War II. Chung gained national fame when she began "adopting" thousands of soldiers, sailors, and flyboys, including Ronald Reagan, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, and Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr. A pioneer in both professional and political realms, Chung experimented in her personal life as well. She adopted masculine dress and had romantic relationships with other women, such as writer Elsa Gidlow and entertainer Sophie Tucker.<br><br>This is the first biography to explore Margaret Chung's remarkable and complex life. It brings alive the bohemian and queer social milieus of Hollywood and San Francisco as well as the wartime celebrity community Chung cultivated. Her life affords a rare glimpse into the possibilities of traversing racial, gender, and sexual boundaries of American society from the late Victorian era through the early Cold War period.</p><p><b>Judy Tzu-Chun Wu</b> is Associate Professor in the Department of History at Ohio State University.</p><h2>Exploring Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology</h2><p>Extensively revised and updated in its fifth edition, <em>Exploring Philosophy: An Introductory Anthology</em> is a uniquely accessible and engaging introduction to philosophy.

Daigler reveals the intelligence activities of famous personalities such as Samuel Adams, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Nathan Hale, John Jay, and Benedict Arnold, as well as many less well-known figures. He examines the important role of intelligence in key theaters of military operations, such as Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and in General Nathanael Greene's campaign in South Carolina; the role of African Americans in the era's intelligence activities; undertakings of networks such as the Culper Ring; and intelligence efforts and paramilitary actions conducted abroad. <br><br><i>Spies, Patriots, and Traitors </i>adds a new dimension to our understanding of the American Revolution.

Bottom line: this reviewer recommends it as a primary introduction in American intelligence courses as well as a general readership volume. ... Above all, this is a well-researched and indexed volume, clearly reflecting the author&#x2019;s extensive and impressive credentials. The source listing is outstanding and in itself worth the purchase price. ... Perhaps the second great value here is the way professional analysis of events and persons provides the reader with a most useful perspective, taking those readers&#x2014;who are not themselves experienced partners in the profession&#x2014;to a much deeper and far more valuable understanding. In this manner, the author takes one well beyond a simple chronology which in it-self has value, but is nonetheless incomplete history. ...&nbsp; Some chapters deserve particular note. Chapter Two, The United Front Campaign That Led to the American Revolution. The discussion on the ramp-up to the Revolution is excellent and most informative. Bottom line: Chapter Two is as good a concise primer on how to foment revolution as probably exists anywhere. ... Chapter Four, Covert Action in Europe Leading to the French Alliance. The focus here on British and European intelligence operations as subjects is a major contribution to better understanding the Intelligence War introduced in Chapter Three. There is an excellent summary linkage between classic covert action concepts and the Revolution with Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s and Silas Dean&#x2019;s specific roles well highlighted. Inclusion of British intelligence operations, including both successes and failures, provides a refreshingly balanced perspective. ...

This little book by a celebrated MIT professor&#x2015;the fiftieth anniversary edition of a classic&#x2015;describes how we learn to live and work with innovation. Elting Morison considers, among other things, the three stages of users' resistance to change: ignoring it; rational rebuttal; and name-calling. He recounts the illustrative anecdote of the World War II artillerymen who stood still to hold the horses despite the fact that the guns were now hitched to trucks&#x2015;reassuring those of us who have trouble with a new interface or a software upgrade that we are not the first to encounter such problems.</p><p>Morison offers an entertaining series of historical accounts to highlight his major theme: the nature of technological change and society's reaction to that change. He begins with resistance to innovation in the U.S. Navy following an officer's discovery of a more accurate way to fire a gun at sea; continues with thoughts about bureaucracy, paperwork, and card files; touches on rumble seats, the ghost in <i>Hamlet</i>, and computers; tells the strange history of a new model steamship in the 1860s; and describes the development of the Bessemer steel process. Each instance teaches a lesson about the more profound and current problem of how to organize and manage systems of ideas, energies, and machinery so that it will conform to the human dimension.</p></p><p>Elting Morison (1909&#x2013;1995) was an American historian of technology, biographer, author, and essayist.

Focusing on the politics surrounding Swahili musical performance, Kelly Askew demonstrates the crucial role of popular culture in Tanzania's colonial and postcolonial history.<br><br>As Askew shows, the genres of <i>ngoma</i> (traditional dance), <i>dansi</i> (urban jazz), and <i>taarab</i> (sung Swahili poetry) have played prominent parts in official articulations of "Tanzanian National Culture" over the years. Drawing on over a decade of research, including extensive experience as a <i>taarab</i> and <i>dansi</i> performer, Askew explores the intimate relations among musical practice, political ideology, and economic change. She reveals the processes and agents involved in the creation of Tanzania's national culture, from government elites to local musicians, poets, wedding participants, and traffic police. Throughout, Askew focuses on performance itself&#x2014;musical and otherwise&#x2014;as key to understanding both nation-building and interpersonal power dynamics.<br><br></p><p><b>Kelly Askew</b> is an assistant professor of anthropology and of Afroamerican and African studies at the University of Michigan.

The major contribution of the book is that, beyond presenting political and musical ethnographies, the author intertwines them to show that music and dance do not simply &#x2018;reflect;&#x2019; rather, they provide the means by which social and political hierarchies are negotiated and transformed. . . . In short, it is a history of Tanzanian nationalism through musical performance.&#x201d; (Margaret Buckner <i>Anthropological Quarterly</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Askew has given us a richly detailed and engaging study of cultural politics in Tanzania during its transition from socialism to multipartyism. . . .

This biography, the first in English or Italian, frames her wartime activism in the Resistenza as a chapter in a lifetime of resistance. Ada Gobetti participated in the underground Giustizia e Liberta movement, and helped to found the Partito d&#39;Azione, a political party whose members asked her to represent them as vice mayor of Turin after the war. For Ada Gobetti, the Resistenza also brought an awareness of the specific talents, needs, and rights of Italian women. This led her to organize other Italian women against German occupiers and Fascist oppressors, found an underground women&#39;s newspaper, and solidify her views regarding women as a political force. After 1945, resistance meant espousing a set of ideals exemplified by the best that came out of the Resistenza, ideals of grassroots democracy, women&#39;s rights, and democratic education for which Ada Gobetti would fight for the rest of her life.</p><p>Jomarie Alano is a visiting scholar at Cornell University&#39;s Institute for European Studies.

It also tells how less volatile issues have impacted those organizations. </p><p> The lessons learned from those incidents form the base message of the book; that <b>faith-based organizations must increase their awareness of (and preparation for) the accidental, criminal, or environmental hazards capable of compromising their primary purpose.</b> </p><p> Active shooters, mass killers, workplace violence, domestic violence and other deadly encounters affect not only schools, theaters and malls but churches as well. All such sites are captive concentrations of typically unprepared victims. </p><p> Evil in Sanctuary is a wake-up call for any mass assembly of people, especially faith-based settings. The book motivates readiness and prepares safety minded professionals to state the case clearly to their leadership, peers and community. </p><p> Evil has invaded sanctuary, and will do so again.</p></p><p>Carl Chinn dismissed the importance of physical security through much of his early career, considering it an inconvenient distraction of debatable value. Then he faced an angry gunman in a ministry, which changed his views. It would turn out to be the first of two gunmen he encountered at ministries. Following the first attacker s trial in 1996, Chinn began researching and writing on the subject of North American ministry incidents especially criminal acts. He maintains a website (carlchinn.com) on the subject and speaks at related conferences. He has been featured in national media and publications including Focus on the Family, The 700 Club, Preaching Magazine, Christianity Today, Moody Bible Institute and radio interviews. He has spoken at colleges, seminaries, churches, ASIS, and various charitable events. He is a frequent speaker for the National Organization of Church Security &amp; Safety Management. In 2009, the Washington Post credited his website as the most comprehensive collection of deadly force incidents at ministries available. The author and his wife raised five children in the Colorado Springs area, and currently enjoy nine grandchildren.Many people of faith still find it unthinkable to believe that a person with violent intent will come into their midst at their place of worship or ministry. Coming face to face with this reality twice, Carl Chinn has chosen to devote over fifteen years to researching and documenting others who have been thrust into this same scenario for the purpose of sounding the trumpet to faith-based organizations. Once you have reviewed Carl's evidence, the answer to the question; Could it happen here? -- is an absolute Yes!<br><br>(SOURCE) Dave Johnson, Facilities/Security Director.

From the Glorious Revolution to the invention of golf, British history is a rich tapestry of enigmatic personalities, contentious politics, indelible legacies, and stunning achievements. For centuries, Britain has been a world leader and innovator, yet its distinct culture, with its fondness for royalty, lukewarm ale and left-hand side driving, remains, at times, impenetrable to the outsider. Now, in <em>The Oxford Companion to British History</em>, readers have a comprehensive and authoritative perspective into all the idiosyncrasies and nuances that make British history so uniquely British.<br> Featuring 4000 A-Z entries written by 120 of the leading political, social, economic, and military scholars in the United Kingdom and Ireland, this single volume reference offers a wealth of information on British history. <em>The Oxford Companion to British History</em> covers all facets of this storied subject, from the arrival of Julius Caesar on British shores in 55 B.C. to John Majors ill-fated back to basics initiative in the 1990s. Readers can explore this rich 2000-year history with insightful and meticulous descriptions of every important person, place, date, and movement in this fabled country, including the political legacies of the Magna Carta and the Gunpowder Plot, the legendary reigns of such monarchs as Henry VIII and Queen Victoria, the social movements of the Luddites and the Parlimentarians, cultural and artistic phenomena like Romanticism and neo-classical architecture, and the scientific achievements of Newton and Darwin. Here the etymology of the cardigan sweater (named after Crimean War hero James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan) and the biography of Mary Wollstonecraft, author of <em>Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> (1792), get equal billing with such familiar figures as William Shakespeare, Oliver Cromwell, and Elizabeth I. In addition, general interest articles on topics like the monarchy and the Second World War are interspersed with more esoteric subjects like Ida, the sixth century king of Bernicia, to create a complete reference of British history. Whether your interest lies in the Beatles, Robin Hood, Northern Ireland, John Locke, the Tower of London, Gothic Architecture, Princess Diana, or beagling (the hunting of hares on foot with the aid of beagle hounds), nothing is slighted. <br> Designed for ease of use, the <em>Companion</em> offers ample cross-referencing between essay-length articles and short, quick-reference entries, supported by 12 detailed maps and an exemplary general index. Ideal for everyone with an interest in British history, <em>The Oxford Companion to British</em> <em>History</em> is the definitive window into this fascinating world.</p><p>From "Abbeys," monastic organizations that were important in local-level medieval government, to "Zutphen, Battle of," where the great poet Sir Philip Sidney lost his life in 1586, this 1,000-plus-page tome offers an erudite register of all things British. Editor John Cannon's emphases are sometimes idiosyncratic--the entry for the Beatles, inarguably influential in British and world history, is as short as that for "beagling," a particular kind of rabbit hunting. <i>The Oxford Companion to British History</i> is an invaluable and well-written resource for Anglophiles nonetheless.<br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> <strong>John Cannon</strong> was formerly Professor of Modern History at The University of Newcastle upon Tyne.

As with all terms that attempt to summarise an epoch, "Romanesque" artificially constructs the notion of one unified style, but as this book makes clear, the Romanesque tendency consisted of many different, eclectic characteristics. The investigation back through time leads us across the ancient pilgrim routes of the Pyrenees, and then into a vast range of devotional structures - churches, tombs, monuments, cathedrals and basilicas. Each one carries its own regional imprint and spiritual iconography. Containing rigorously detailed and comprehensive insights into all aspects of Romanesque symbolism and ritual, this book includes analysis of liturgical equipment, and explores the significance of many features of the buildings. </p><p>The Author: <br> Xavier Barral i Altet is the well-known Professor of Art History in the Middle Ages at Rennes University.

And for just as long, the question of how to deal with urban wastes has taxed the minds of scientists, engineers, and public officials - and the pocketbooks of ordinary citizens. For more than twenty years, Joel A. Tarr has written about the issues of urban pollution. In this collection of his essays, Professor Tarr surveys what technology has done to, and for, the environment of the American city since 1850. In studies ranging from the horse to the railroad, from infrastructure development to industrial and domestic pollution, from the Hudson River to the smokestacks of Pittsburgh, his constant theme is the tension between the production of wastes and the attempts to dispose of them or control them with minimal costs. The Search for the Ultimate Sink: Urban Pollution in Historical Perspective stands alone in its scholarly depth and scope. These essays explore not only the technical solutions to waste disposal, but also the policy issues involved in the trade-offs among public health, environmental quality, and the difficulties and costs of pollution control, and all this against the broader background of changes in civic and professional values. Any reader concerned with the interactive history of technology, the environment, and the American city will find in The Search for the Ultimate Sink an informative and compelling account of pollution problems from the past and a serious guide to urban policies for the future.</p><p>Joel A. Tarr is the Richard S. Caliguiri Professor of Urban and Environmental History and Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his BS and MA degrees at Rutgers University and his PhD from Northwestern University. Among his many publications is the co-edited collection, Technology and the Rise of the Networked City in Europe and America, 1988 winner of the Abel Wolman Award from the Public Works Historical Society. He has been awarded fellowships and grants from several institutions, including the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><h2>The Eliminationists: How Hate Talk Radicalized the American Right</h2><p><i>The Eliminationists</i> describes the malignant influence of right-wing hate talk on the American conservative movement. Tracing much of this vitriol to the dank corners of the para-fascist right, award-winning reporter David Neiwert documents persistent ideas and rhetoric that champion the elimination of opposition groups. As a result of this hateful discourse, Neiwert argues, the broader conservative movement has metastasized into something not truly conservative, but decidedly right-wing and potentially dangerous.<br>By tapping into the eliminationism latent in the American psyche, the mainstream conservative movement has emboldened groups that have inhabited the fringes of the far right for decades. With the Obama victory, their voices may once again raise the specter of deadly domestic terrorism that characterized the far Right in the 1990s. How well Americans face this challenge will depend on how strongly we repudiate the politics of hate and repair the damage it has wrought.</p><p>For over a decade, David Neiwert has been America's canary in the coal mine--our national early-warning system on the spread of corrosive, eliminationist, right-wing hatred in our midst. His latest book is a reality-based antidote to Jonah Goldberg, notable for both its clarity and moral force. --<b>Rick Perlstein,</b> <i>Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America</i><p> </p><p>David Neiwert is one of the most knowledgeable and careful reporters on the far right in America. <i>The Eliminationists</i> irrefutably documents the connection between extremist word and extremist deed. As Neiwert demonstrates, absolutist language corrupts absolutely. The shocking history he presents is undeniable, but it is not a matter of the past. The danger is clear and present. --<b>Sidney Blumenthal,</b> former senior adviser to President Clinton and Hillary Clinton</p><p> </p><p>David Neiwert is among the most astute analysts of the contemporary right. Read <i>The Eliminationists</i> to learn why he worries about a resurgence of the most violent and dangerous elements in our politics. --<b>Joe Conason,</b> <i>Big Lies: The Right-Wing Propaganda Machine and How It Distorts the Truth</i></p><p> </p><p>The core observation of David Neiwert's <i>The Eliminationists</i>--that the mainstream right increasingly deploys "eliminationist" rhetoric against its enemies--is indisputable.

There are numerous new case studies, and new discussions of the differences between MFT as a distinct profession and MFT as a professional subspecialty. In addition, a completely new chapter explores contemporary ethical issues for which no formal precedent has yet been established. With its practical focus and planned, concise coverage, the book ensures students to gain both a theoretical background and an applications orientation. In each of the three major sections, chapters address &#34;general&#34; issues, as well as issues specific to marriage and family therapy. A concluding chapter in each section offers case illustrations that expand upon the material covered in the previous chapter. This two-step presentation helps students attain a greater understanding of how information is used in actual practice...and helps them more effectively internalize instruction.Preface <p> Although less than 100 years old, professional psychotherapy has become a major influence in society. Therapists contribute to and considerably affect many aspects of modern life. During this time, psychotherapy has broadened its perspective. No longer is it practiced exclusively on a one-therapist-to-one-client basis. Group therapy efforts have become commonplace in almost every mental health setting. Likewise, the last several decades have seen the advent of another expansion within the psychotherapeutic field, that of marriage and family therapy. </p><p> Many therapists have replaced or supplemented their traditional individual and group models of practice with one emphasizing couples and families as the dominant treatment focus. This is not to suggest that contact with marital partners and other family members had been completely ignored. Rather, marital partners and family members had always been considered in light of the individual client's concerns and from an individually oriented therapeutic perspective. </p><p> As the practice of marriage and family therapy has evolved, training procedures have become more explicit, replicable, and accessible. Specific theories and techniques have been identified. Broad curricular components for training have been compiled. And specific content, goals, and teaching methods for university coursework and professional workshops have been delineated. These materials and strategies all continue to be researched, evaluated, and enhanced. Noticeably lacking before the publication of the first edition of Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in the Practice of Marriage and Family Therapy, however, were sources addressing "nontherapy" issues necessary to supplement the therapeutic training of marriage and family therapists (Piercy &amp; Sprenkle, 1983). </p><p> The importance of these nontherapy issues was emphasized in an article entitled "Family Therapy May Be Dangerous for Your Health" (Hare-Mustin, 1980), in which the author states: </p><p> In sum, family therapy may not be in the best interests of individual family members.<br> Family therapists and their clients need to be aware of possible risks to the rights of<br> the individual member. By being required to participate, individuals may have to<br> subordinate their own goals and give up limited confidentiality and privacy. In addition,<br> therapists who idealize the traditional family may foster stereotyped roles and expectations<br> in the family that disadvantage individuals and limit their well-being and mental health. (p. 938)</p><p></p><p> Although offerings in the professional literature and training opportunities at conferences and workshops have increased in both number and quality, nontherapy issues&#x2014;particularly ethical, legal, and associated professional concerns&#x2014;are still underrepresented in relation to their potential impact on the practice of many mental health professionals. The simple fact that marriage and family therapy differs from individual and group therapy on both conceptual and pragmatic levels requires that therapists be adequately prepared to handle controversial issues from a marriage and family perspective as well. Questions that are difficult in individual and group therapy can become significantly more complicated when a couple or whole family presents itself for services (Margolin, 1982). </p><p> The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, the professional organization with which most marriage and family therapists are primarily affiliated, specifies graduate-level coursework in "professional studies" as a requirement within its educational requirements for clinical membership. In response, courses in "ethical, legal, and professional issues" have been developed and constitute a core component of marriage and family training programs. The first and second editions of Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in the Practice of Marriage and Family Therapy served as a basic text for these courses as well as a primary source for practicing professionals seeking to expand their knowledge of ethical, legal, and professional issues in marriage and family therapy. ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT </p><p> This third edition has been updated and expanded so that it may continue to serve as a basic resource for both beginning students and practicing professionals. It is divided into three parts. Part 1 addresses ethical issues in marriage and family therapy. Chapter 1 examines major ethical issues confronting all therapists, particularly the beginning marriage and family therapist and the experienced practitioner who is shifting from an individual approach to a marriage and family perspective. Chapter 2 discusses ethical issues inherent in the interactive nature of marriage and family therapy. Chapter 3 presents contemporary ethical issues for which there is little precedent; positions advocated in the professional literature and recommendations made for handling these issues are reviewed. Chapter 4 offers a "casebook" of examples with critiques highlighting the AAMFT Code of Ethics (American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, 1998). Part 2 considers legal issues in marriage and family therapy. Chapter 5 investigates the roles and relationships of marriage and family therapists within the legal system. Chapter 6 examines relevant family law. Chapter 7, like Chapter 4, is a casebook of examples with critiques discussing the impact of legal issues on marriage and family therapy. Part 3 focuses on professional issues. Chapter 8 discusses "valuing" and the professional practice of marriage and family therapy. Chapter 9 explores the professional identity of a marriage and family therapist. Chapter 10 offers another casebook of examples addressing professional questions. </p><p> Special attention should be paid to the three casebook chapters: 4, 7, and 10. We recall our days as clinicians-in-training seeking to fathom those notions we garnered from our readings. Classroom instructors and clinical supervisors, knowledgeable and skilled from years of experience, provided case examples to illustrate the concepts more clearly. Those illustrations made learning a more concrete experience, from which we emerged much better prepared. </p><p> Overall, this book seeks to encourage a greater familiarization and expansion of knowledge relevant to ethical, legal, and professional issues necessary to supplement clinical training and practice in marriage and family therapy We hope that you will gain an introduction to some of the issues you may encounter and that you will be stimulated to think about your own position as a marriage and family therapist, whether as a primary source of professional identity or professional specialization. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> So many persons have contributed, both directly and indirectly, to our personal and professional development and to the writing of this book that it is impossible to thank them all. We thank the majority of them as a group by offering this book as a contribution of social interest that will, we hope, enhance the lives of mental health professionals and the clients with whom they interact. A few individuals, however, need to be singled out for special thanks. </p><p> Lee Baruth coauthored the first edition of this book. Without his many contributions, this work would not have been possible. For their constructive suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript, we thank reviewers Robert Barrett, University of North Carolina-Charlotte; Sarah G. Gabbay, Colorado State University; Lizbeth Ann Gray, Oregon State University; and Michael Poison, East Carolina University. We are particularly indebted to Kevin Davis, the executive editor for this project at Merrill/Prentice Hall. </p><p> Finally, we thank those who have made personal contributions to our lives. From Sam Gladding: "I am indebted to my parents, Russell and Gertrude, for their attention to teaching me the importance of values at a young age. My wife, Claire, and our children, Ben, Nate, and Tim, have been both understanding and supportive during my times of writing for this book. A family's encouragement and company cannot be valued enough." From Ted Remley: "I want to thank my parents, TE and Era, for giving me the education necessary to write books. I also appreciate my extended family, close friends, colleagues, and graduate students for tolerating my absences when I write and my crabby disposition when I am trying to make deadlines." And from Charles Huber: "I thank my parents, Charles and Helen, for modeling for me those core ethical qualities I had only to label, not learn, when I began my professional training and later entered clinical practice. My partner, Betsy, and our children, David and Morgan, have been most patient during the writing of the revision." </p><p> Samuel T Gladding, Ph. D.<br> Theodore E Remley, Jr., Ph.D.<br> Charles H.

Marley</b> is a writer, teacher, and naval historian, and is an internationally known expert in the history of imperial conflicts in the New World.</p><i>Wars of the Americas</i> is the most recent entry in the crowded field of chronologies. Seeking to fill a gap, Canadian writer-historian Marley has created a work that fleshes out a military chronology of the Americas. He warns at the outset, "inevitably, any attempt to compress 500 years of warfare into a single volume must entail certain compromises." These compromises turn out to be what the author considers underreported or ignored minor confrontations, and they do seem to be minor, indeed.<p>The volume is divided into eight sections, each of which takes on 50 to 100 years of history and is subdivided into important military themes. For example, the beginning section, "Discovery and Conquest (1492^-1572)," is divided into smaller chronologies such as "Initial Contacts (1492^-1498)"; "Conquest of Mexico (1517^-1521)"; and "Conquest of Peru (1524^-1539)." Each subsection is introduced by a brief overview. Each of the events in the chronology that follows includes a paragraph or two of narrative explaining its historical significance. The last section, "Pax Americana (1898^-Present)" , ends with such recent events as the occupation of the Japanese embassy in Lima by Tupac Amaru guerrillas and the retirement of Chile's General Augusto Pinochet in March 1998.</p><p>The volume includes many illustrations from famous works of art or historical photographs--many from the author's own private collection--as well as line drawings of military maps. A 12-page, topically arranged bibliography lists a selection of the works that were consulted by the author. An index provides access by major event or personal name, enhancing the usefulness of the resource.</p><p>With so many chronologies available, reference librarians must choose carefully. The well-reviewed <i>Harper's Encyclopedia of Military History: From 3500 B.C. to the Present</i> [RBB N 1 93], also arranged chronologically, may satisfy many smaller libraries' needs in this area. But if more comprehensive American coverage is needed, one could not go wrong with the purchase of <i>Wars of the Americas</i>.

These rules are each followed by an explanation of the rule&#39;s important advice on how to implement it, and are supported by actual programming examples.</p><p>This book is a direct outgrowth of my experiences teaching C++ to professional programmers through the Institute for Advanced Professional Studies. I found that most students, after a week of intensive instruction, felt comfortable with the basic constructs of the language, but were less sanguine about their ability to put the constructs together in an effective manner. Thus began my attempt to formulate short, specific, easy-to-remember guidelines for effective software development in C++: a summary of the things that experienced C++ programmers either almost always do or almost always avoid. <p>As a computer scientist, I was originally interested in rules that could be checked by a machine. To that end, I outlined a program to examine C++ software for constructs that were "almost always wrong." Currently under development, this checking program has become known as lint++. However, it quickly became apparent that the great majority of the guidelines used by good C++ programmers were too difficult to formalize, or had too many important exceptions, to be blindly enforced by a lint++-like program. </p><p>That led me to the notion of something less precise than a computer program but still more focused and to-the-point than a general C++ textbook. The result you now hold in your hands: a book containing 50 specific suggestions on how to improve your C++ programs and designs. </p><p>In this book you'll find advice on what you should do, and why, and what you should not do, and why not. Fundamentally, of course, the whys are much more important than the whats, but from a purely pragmatic point of view, it is much more convenient to have a list of guidelines in front of you than it is to memorize a textbook or two. Unlike most books on C++, my presentation here is not organized around particular language features. That is, I don't talk about constructors in one place, aboutvirtual functions in another, about inheritance in a third, etc. Instead, each explanation is tightly coupled to the specific guideline it accompanies, and my coverage of the various aspects of a particular feature is typically dispersed throughout the book. </p><p>The advantage of this approach is that it better reflects the complexity of the software systems for which C++ is often chosen, systems in which the understanding of individual language features is not enough. For example, experienced C++ developers know that understanding inline functions and understanding virtual destructors does not necessarily mean that you understand inline virtual destructors. Such battle-scarred developers recognize that comprehending the interactions between the features in C++ is of the greatest possible importance in using the language effectively. The organization of this book reflects that fundamental truth. </p><p>The disadvantage of my approach is that you may have to look in more than one place to discover everything I have to say about a particular construct in C++. To minimize the inconvenience inherent in this approach, I have sprinkled cross-references liberally throughout the text, and a comprehensive index is provided at the end of the book. </p><p>The set of guidelines in this book is far from exhaustive, but coming up with good rules - ones that are applicable to almost all applications almost all the time - is harder than it looks. Perhaps you know of additional guidelines, of more ways in which to program effectively in C++. If so, I would be delighted to hear about them. </p><p>On the other hand, you may feel that some of the items in this book are inappropriate as general advice; that there is a better way to accomplish a task examined in the book; or that one or more of the technical discussions is unclear, incomplete, or misleading. I encourage you to let me know about these things, too. </p><p>Donald Knuth has a long history of offering a small reward for people who notify him of errors in his books. The quest for a perfect book is laudable in any case, but in view of the number of bug-ridden C++ books that have been rushed to market, I feel especially strongly compelled to follow Knuth's example. Therefore, for each error in this book that is reported to me - be it technical, grammatical, typographical, or otherwise - I will, in future printings, gladly acknowledge the first person to report that error. </p><p>Send your suggested guidelines, your comments, your criticisms, and - sigh - your bug reports to: </p><p>Scott Meyersc/o Editor-in-Chief, Corporate and Professional Publishing Addison-Wesley Publishing Company 1 Jacob Way Reading, MA 01867 U.

I guarantee that some combination of these 50 items will grab and enlighten you, and repay your modest investment... This is a well-written, honest book aimed at C++ programmers who are converging toward fluency and effectiveness." -- Stan Kelly-Bootle, Unix Review Scott Meyers presents 50 concise rules based on what experienced C++ developers almost always do - or almost always avoid - to create efficient, portable, and maintainable software. Each rule is accompanied by examples that illustrate the rule at work. If you want to be a proficient C++ programmer, you will need to understand the complex interactions between the many features in the language. This incisive guide offers insight into the most important interactions. </p><p>Among its unique benefits, this book offers: Expert guidance on object-oriented design, class design, and the proper use of inheritance Innovative ways to simulate features your compiler may not have Accumulated wisdom traditionally passed informally from programmer to programmer </p><p>This book corresponds to the definition of C++, including templates and exceptions, found in The Annotated C++ Reference Manual by Ellis and Stroustrup, and is also must reading for programmers with compilers supporting earlier versions of the language. With this book, you will learn how to write large scale software even if your compiler does not provide for nested types, templates, or exceptions.

Amstutz illustrates the role of moral norms in global politics with twenty-five revised and new case studies. The cases are focused on eight major global issues: political reconciliation, human rights, war, irregular war, foreign intervention, economic sanctions, justice among states, and global justice. This clearly written study will be of special interest to students and practitioners of international affairs who are concerned with the role of political morality and ethical judgment in global affairs.</p><p>Mark R. Amstutz is professor of political science at Wheaton College, Illinois.In this updated and revised edition (1st ed., CH, Jan'00, 37-3018) Amstutz (Wheaton College) emphasizes the relevance of moral principles to international politics. Twenty-five updated and/or new cases are employed in this study to demonstrate that morality is essential to foreign policy. These cases are among the central and topical world problems subjected to scrupulous evaluation: human rights, war, economic sanctions, international economic relations, the ethics of foreign intervention, and promotion of global justice. Amstutz takes to task the realist tenet that international politics is the inherent pursuit of power and economic interest. He claims that both states and non-state participants adhere to a common moral foundation that influences major decision making. Amstutz is quite successful in presenting his viewpoint discussing NATO intervention in Kosovo, Carter's human rights policy, South Africa reconciliation, and U.S. intervention in Libya. The book is well-written and accessible to professionals and those who have an avid interest in global politics. It makes a significant contribution to the development and study of theory of international relations. Summing Up: Highly recommended. All readership levels.

(Nicole Bibbins Sedaca, chair, Global Politics and Security Concentration, Georgetown University)</p><h2>Understanding American Politics, Second Edition</h2><p><p><em>Understanding American Politics</em> provides a unique introduction to the contemporary political landscape of the United States by using as its core organizing feature the idea of "American exceptionalism," a concept that is at least as old as Tocqueville's study of American democracy. </p><p>The second edition of <em>Understanding American Politics</em> maintains the unique strengths of the first edition while offering improved coverage of political institutions. A single omnibus chapter on institutions has been reorganized and split into three separate chapters on Congress, the presidency, and the courts. A new chapter on public opinion has also been included, and the chapter on religion and politics has been completely rewritten with a deeper appreciation of religion's influential role. The book has been revised throughout, taking into account the dramatic changes that have emerged since the 2010 congressional elections and the 2012 presidential election. The text also pays close attention to what is seen as the irreversible decline in America's global influence.</p><p>Visit www.utpamericanpolitics.com for additional resources.</p></p><p><b>Stephen Brooks</b> is Professor of Political Science at the University of Windsor and teaches political science at the University of Michigan.

Tracing the role of Chicanas from pre-Columbian society to the present, the authors reveal the antecedents and roots of contemporary cultural expectations in Aztec, colonial, and revolutionary Mexican historical periods.

In five hundred substantial essays written by major scholars, the <em>Encyclopedia of British Literature</em> includes biographies of nearly four hundred individual authors and a hundred topical essays with detailed analyses of particular themes, movements, genres, and institutions whose impact upon the writing or the reading of literature was significant.<br> An ideal companion to <em>The Oxford Encyclopedia of American Literature</em>, this set will prove invaluable for students, scholars, and general readers.<br> For more information, including a complete table of contents and list of contributors, please visit www.oup.com/us/ebl<br></p><p><br><strong>EDITORIAL BOARD</strong><br><br>Editor in Chief<br>David Scott Kastan, Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities and Chair of the Department of English and Comparative Literature,<em>Columbia University</em><br><br>Senior Editors<br>Nancy Armstrong, Nancy Duke Lewis Professor of English and Comparative Literature,<em>Brown University</em><br>Kevin J.

Kenan, Jr. Professor of English and Humanities,<em>Davidson College</em><br>Jennifer Wicke, Department of English,<em>University of Virginia</em><br>*Starred Review* By defining <i>British literature</i> as the literature of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this compendium excludes English-language literatures published in Commonwealth countries and thus focuses on writings that originated in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. Kastan, an English professor at Columbia University, coordinated a five-member editorial board and a team of 371 contributors from academic institutions in the U.S., Canada, Britain, and Australia to bring together this scholarly and well-written encyclopedia.<p>The 509 alphabetically arranged essays range in length from 2 to 11 pages. (Because Shakespeare is the subject of five separate articles, his total treatment is considerably longer.) About 385 of the entries are devoted to individuals, who range chronologically from Caedmon to J. K. Rowling and include an intriguing selection of major and minor authors as well as such diverse figures as the Beatles, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, and Queen Victoria. The remaining essays treat institutions (<i>Abbey Theatre, Poet laureate, Stationers' Company</i>); genres (<i>Anglo-Saxon riddles, Detective fiction, Restoration drama</i>); movements and groups (<i>Angry Young Men, </i><i>Bluestockings, Pre-Raphaelites</i>); titles (<i>The Mabinogion, Oxford English Dictionary, Piers Plowman</i>); and general topics (<i>Censorship, Literary theory, Narrative</i>). Each entry concludes with a list of major primary works and a selective secondary bibliography accompanied by brief but helpful annotations. Many entries also include cross-references to other articles and small black-and-white illustrations. Volume 1 contains a list of the articles in all five volumes and a chronological chart that links the subjects of entries with major historical events, while volume 5 provides a directory of contributors and an extensive and detailed 151-page index. </p><p>The editor's decisions regarding writers and works for inclusion reflect an academic focus and a penchant for the esoteric. While eschewing entries for Anita Brookner, Winston Churchill, P. D. James, Thomas Kyd, William Trevor, and other well-known authors, he includes essays on a number of lesser-known, even obscure writers, such as Osbern Bokenham, John Capgrave, and Ann Vaughan Lock. In addition, most of the title entries feature early manuscript texts that generally are studied only at the college level. </p><p>Containing more than 1,200 entries, the <i>Continuum Encyclopedia of British Literature</i> (2003) provides greater breadth of coverage--particularly of recent writers--but not as much depth. About 60 percent of the individuals accorded entries in the Oxford encyclopedia are also covered in Scribner's British Writers series, and almost all of them are featured in Gale's <i>Dictionary of Literary Biography</i>. For those with access to these sources, the most valuable aspect of the new Oxford offering may well be its substantive coverage of topics and themes related to British literature. Although some essays appear to be aimed at graduate students and scholars, much of the content is appropriate for lower-level college students and general readers. Highly recommended for academic libraries and could also be a useful addition to larger public libraries. <i>Marie Ellis</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Originally intended for the wealthy, these private investments have now attracted a much broader following that includes pension funds and retail investors. Because hedge funds are largely unregulated and shrouded in secrecy, they have developed a mystique and allure that can beguile even the most experienced investor. In <i>Hedge Funds</i>, Andrew Lo--one of the world's most respected financial economists--addresses the pressing need for a systematic framework for managing hedge fund investments.</p><br><br><p>Arguing that hedge funds have very different risk and return characteristics than traditional investments, Lo constructs new tools for analyzing their dynamics, including measures of illiquidity exposure and performance smoothing, linear and nonlinear risk models that capture alternative betas, econometric models of hedge fund failure rates, and integrated investment processes for alternative investments. He concludes with a case study of quantitative equity strategies in August 2007, and presents a sobering outlook regarding the systemic risks posed by this industry.</p></p><p><p>"Andrew Lo's <i>Hedge Funds</i> is likely to be the high-water mark in the analysis of hedge funds for years to come. Focusing on hedge fund returns and trading strategies, risk characteristics, and potential for illiquidity, Lo brings to bear his always fresh and insightful thinking."<b>--Richard Bookstaber, author of <i>A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds, and the Perils of Financial Innovation</i></b></p><p>"Lo offers a truly unique perspective. He examines the properties of returns and illiquidity in great detail and introduces an innovative concept of mean-variance-liquidity optimization, something that no other book on hedge funds has addressed."<b>--Narayan Y. Naik, London Business School</b></p><p>"This book provides a useful and very timely overview of key aspects of the hedge fund industry. It summarizes the basic properties of hedge fund returns, discusses why traditional performance measures may be misleading when analyzing hedge fund performance, and highlights important issues such as serial correlation, return smoothing, and illiquidity."<b>--Markus K.

But&nbsp;where did Atlantis come from, what was it like,&nbsp;and where did it go to?</p><p>Atlantis was first introduced by the Greek&nbsp;philosopher Plato in the fourth&nbsp;century BC. As he discusses about the origins&nbsp;of life, the universe and humanity, the&nbsp;great thinker puts forward a&nbsp;stunning description of Atlantis&#x2015;an island paradise with&nbsp;an ideal society.&nbsp;But the Atlanteans soon degenerate and become&nbsp;imperialist aggressors: they&nbsp;choose to fight against antediluvian Athens,&nbsp;which heroically repels their mighty&nbsp;forces, before a cataclysmic natural&nbsp;disaster destroys the warring states.</p><p>Plato's dialogues appear remarkably prescient today. Not because they invite a search for a mysterious lost continent, but because of their warnings about the pernicious effects of wealth and power on a ruling class: Atlantis-style luxury, excess, corruption, and imperialism can lead only to decay and disaster. This&nbsp;ever-important tale&nbsp;should be prescribed reading for every political leader.</p><p>Plato&#x2019;s tale of a great empire that sank beneath&nbsp;the waves has sparked&nbsp;thousands of years of debate over whether Atlantis&nbsp;really existed. But did Plato&nbsp;mean his tale as history&#x2015;or just as a parable&nbsp;to help illustrate his philosophy?</p></p><p>Dr. Stephen P. Kershaw&nbsp;has spent the majority of his career in&nbsp;the world of the ancient&nbsp;Greeks, both intellectually and physically. He has been a Classics tutor&nbsp;for twenty-five years and currently teaches at Oxford University. Kershaw has&nbsp;been&nbsp;commissioned to write Oxford University's new course on the Minoans&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mycenaeans, which will include investigations into the Atlantis tale in relation&nbsp;to the&nbsp;eruption of the Santorini volcano. Kershaw also runs the European&nbsp;Studies Classical&nbsp;Tour for Rhodes College and the University of the&nbsp;South. He has written&nbsp;several books, including&nbsp;A Brief Guide to the Greek Myths&nbsp;and&nbsp;A Brief History of the&nbsp;Roman Empire.&nbsp;Dr. Kershaw lives in England.&#x201c;Mr. Kershaw&#x2019;s subject is not Plato&#x2019;s text but the ways in which readers have dealt with it over the millennia. As his exhaustive survey shows, Atlantis has been adapted to countless ideologies and agendas over time, serving the needs of every sort of reader&#x2015;&#x2018;harmless hippies or Heinrich Himmler,&#x2019; in Mr. Kershaw&#x2019;s memorable phrase. The tortured moves that Mr. Kershaw documents, by which the Atlantis myth has been recast as fact and willfully misread, remind us of how vital such distinctions are for a society striving to stay free.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In addition to presenting assorted bizarre theories, Kershaw explores Greek and Egyptian mythology, Homeric works, and mid-fifth-century Athenian culture. He believes Plato's message is &#x2018;a timeless one about the pernicious effects of wealth on the ruling class.&#x2019; A treasure trove of information for readers seduced by the drowned land.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A comprehensive debunking of the idea that Atlantis is an actual historical location. Readers interested in the classics will find this satisfying.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><h2>Introduction to Algorithms</h2><p>The updated new edition of the classic Introduction to Algorithms is intended primarily for use in undergraduate or graduate courses in algorithms or data structures. Like the first edition, this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. <p>In its new edition, Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity, and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. </p><p>As in the classic first edition, this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further, the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds. </p><p> Each chapter presents an algorithm, a design technique, an application area, or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another, so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally, the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems, giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises that reinforce the concepts the students are learning.</p></p><p>Aimed at any serious programmer or computer science student, the new second edition of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> builds on the tradition of the original with a truly magisterial guide to the world of algorithms. Clearly presented, mathematically rigorous, and yet approachable even for the math-averse, this title sets a high standard for a textbook and reference to the best algorithms for solving a wide range of computing problems.<p>With sample problems and mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of each algorithm, this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its reach doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job of explaining each algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some math background to appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.) Every algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented in any computer language, including C/C++ and Java. This ecumenical approach is one of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and common data structures, from basic linked lists to trees (including binary trees, red-black, and B-trees), this title really shines, with clear diagrams that show algorithms in operation. Even if you just glance over the mathematical notation here, you can definitely benefit from this text in other ways.</p><p>The book moves forward with more advanced algorithms that implement strategies for solving more complicated problems (including dynamic programming techniques, greedy algorithms, and amortized analysis). Algorithms for graphing problems (used in such real-world business problems as optimizing flight schedules or flow through pipelines) come next. In each case, the authors provide the best from current research in each topic, along with sample solutions.</p><p>This text closes with a grab bag of useful algorithms including matrix operations and linear programming, evaluating polynomials, and the well-known Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) (useful in signal processing and engineering). Final sections on "NP-complete" problems, like the well-known traveling salesman problem, show off that while not all problems have a demonstrably final and best answer, algorithms that generate acceptable approximate solutions can still be used to generate useful, real-world answers.</p><p>Throughout this text, the authors anchor their discussion of algorithms with current examples drawn from molecular biology (like the Human Genome Project), business, and engineering. Each section ends with short discussions of related historical material, often discussing original research in each area of algorithms. On the whole, they argue successfully that algorithms are a "technology" just like hardware and software that can be used to write better software that does more, with better performance. Along with classic books on algorithms (like Donald Knuth's three-volume set, <i>The Art of Computer Programming</i>), this title sets a new standard for compiling the best research in algorithms. For any experienced developer, regardless of their chosen language, this text deserves a close look for extending the range and performance of real-world software. <i>--Richard Dragan</i> </p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> Overview of algorithms (including algorithms as a technology); designing and analyzing algorithms; asymptotic notation; recurrences and recursion; probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms; heapsort algorithms; priority queues; quicksort algorithms; linear time sorting (including radix and bucket sort); medians and order statistics (including minimum and maximum); introduction to data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees); hash tables (including hash functions); binary search trees; red-black trees; augmenting data structures for custom applications; dynamic programming explained (including assembly-line scheduling, matrix-chain multiplication, and optimal binary search trees); greedy algorithms (including Huffman codes and task-scheduling problems); amortized analysis (the accounting and potential methods); advanced data structures (including B-trees, binomial and Fibonacci heaps, representing disjoint sets in data structures); graph algorithms (representing graphs, minimum spanning trees, single-source shortest paths, all-pairs shortest paths, and maximum flow algorithms); sorting networks; matrix operations; linear programming (standard and slack forms); polynomials and the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT); number theoretic algorithms (including greatest common divisor, modular arithmetic, the Chinese remainder theorem, RSA public-key encryption, primality testing, integer factorization); string matching; computational geometry (including finding the convex hull); NP-completeness (including sample real-world NP-complete problems and their insolvability); approximation algorithms for NP-complete problems (including the traveling salesman problem); reference sections for summations and other mathematical notation, sets, relations, functions, graphs and trees, as well as counting and probability backgrounder (plus geometric and binomial distributions).</p>There are books on algorithms that are rigorous but incomplete and others that cover masses of material but lack rigor. <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.<p>The first edition became the standard reference for professionals and a widely used text in universities worldwide. The second edition features new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming, as well as extensive revisions to virtually every section of the book. In a subtle but important change, loop invariants are introduced early and used throughout the text to prove algorithm correctness. Without changing the mathematical and analytic focus, the authors have moved much of the mathematical foundations material from Part I to an appendix and have included additional motivational material at the beginning.</p></p><h2>A Man of Salt and Trees: The Life of Joy Morton</h2><p><p>A Man of Salt and Trees is the first full-length biography of Joy Morton (1855-1934), founder of The Morton Arboretum&#x2014;an internationally acclaimed outdoor museum of woody plants&#x2014;and Morton Salt&#x2014;the brand that for over a century has been a household name in the United States. Joy Morton�s story begins in the pre&#x2013;Civil War Nebraska Territory and concludes in the midst of the Great Depression in Chicago, the city in which he lived for over a half century. Using the voluminous correspondence of the Morton family, Ballowe tells the story of the Nebraska farm boy who grew up to be a small town banker who became a leading citizen of Chicago and Illinois and a major figure in the nation�s economic and technological development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. <br> <br>Morton left his mark in several areas, from business and city planning to transportation and environmental preservation. He was a contributor to the development of Daniel H. Burnham and Edward Bennett�s 1909 Plan of Chicago, which continues to affect the way Chicagoans protect the Lakefront and approach transportation and park issues throughout the region. During the last three decades of his life, Morton served on the Chicago Plan Commission. His interest in transportation led him to become an investor and a director in railroad transportation and a champion of inland waterway traffic. He also single-handedly financed early advancements of the teletype, a technology that advanced the economic and cultural development of the 20th century. <br> <br>Toward the end of his life, Morton funded the University of Chicago�s explorations of Mississippian Indian culture in central Illinois and traveled throughout the world visiting ancient as well as modern cultures and gardens. The Morton Arboretum stands today as a natural expression of a desire Joy Morton had from childhood, when he learned from his father, the founder of Arbor Day, and his mother, a dedicated gardener, that a necessary complement to a good life is the cultivation and preservation of the environment.</p></p><p><p>James Ballowe, Distinguished Professor of English Emeritus at Bradley University, teaches in the Naturalist Certificate Program at The Morton Arboretum. He has received awards from the Illinois Arts Council for his poetry and creative non-fiction and the Delta Award from the Morris Library at Southern Illinois University for his publications on Southern Illinois. He is the editor of George Santayana's America: Essays in Literature and Culture.</p><p>""[This is a] fine biography that Ballowe constructed from a careful study mainly of Morton's personal and family papers. A man of salt and trees? Yes, and much more."&#x2015;EH.Net"</p><br><br><p>""Clearly organized and well-written. Ballowe makes excellent use of primary sources to create a literate and engaging biography."&#x2015;Ann Keating, North Central College"</p><br><br><p>""Ballowe gives the reader a life that can be touched, encompassed, and which feels natural....As one reads the book Morton's human side is clear and fascinating."&#x2015;Journal of Illinois History"</p><br><br><p>""The great strength of this book is its use of Morton Papers to give a close reading of the subject's life and corporate achievements. It provides a concrete case study of larger themes and issues historians associate with Chicago's coming of age as a regional and national center of commerce and culture."&#x2015;Dennis Downey, Millersville University"</p></p><h2>Our Fathers&#39; Fields: A Southern Story</h2><p>When James Everett Kibler purchased a dilapidated South Carolina plantation in 1989, he had no idea that his rehabilitation of the distinguished but deteriorated property would include the unearthing of a remarkable saga about the land and the people who had lived on it. But as he refurbished the Great House and restored its nineteenth-century garden, he felt the pull of the place to uncover and record its past. Kibler faithfully took part in an act of cultural reclamation, piecing together the story of the Hardy family, who purchased the tract along the Tyger River in 1786 and farmed it for two centuries. Part epic, part history, part memoir, the resulting tale is a comprehensive, ambitious, and eminently readable chronicle that spans six generations of a family in pursuit of the agrarian ideal.</p><p>James Everett Kibler is a professor of English at the University of Georgia. Born and raised in upcountry South Carolina, Kibler spends much of his spare time tending to the renovation of an 1804 plantation home and the reforestation of the surrounding acreage. The history and saga of this house is chronicled in his critically acclaimed Our Fathers&#39; Fields: A Southern Story, for which he was awarded the prestigious Fellowship of Southern Writers Award for Nonfiction. Kibler divides his time between Whitmire, South Carolina, and Athens, Georgia.The author lives on a South Carolina plantation, an ancestral seat that he has restored to former glory. The Hardy family acquired this extensive piece of property in 1786, and it was to remain in Hardy hands for two centuries. When Kibler bought it, he got involved not only in the resurrection of the house and land but also in the story of the Hardy family, and in this exuberantly detailed narrative, he tells all he learned. His book is a greatly revealing immersion in southern plantation life from colonial times to the present. Vivid reconstructions of farming practices, domestic tasks, and what the Civil War did to antebellum life give context to meticulously researched details about specific topics, ranging from the plasterwork found inside the house to the plants in the formal gardens outside. Overarching the factual material are the stories of the family members, who are brought vividly to life here. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>Richelieu and Olivares (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern History)</h2><p>Cardinal Richelieu is one of the best known and most studied statesmen in European history; his Spanish contemporary and rival, the Count-Duke of Olivares, one of the least known. The contrasting historical fortunes of the two men reflect the outcome of the great struggle in seventeenth-century Europe between France and Spain: the triumph of France assured the fame of Richelieu, while Spain&#39;s failure condemned Olivares to historical neglect. This fascinating book by the distinguished historian J. H. Elliott argues that contemporaries, for whom Olivares was at least as important as Richelieu, shared none of posterity&#39;s certainty about the inevitability of that outcome. His absorbing comparative portrait of the two men, as personalities and as statesmen, through their policies and their mutual struggle, offers unique insights into seventeenth-century Europe and the nature of power and statesmanship.</p><p>Cardinal Richelieu is one of the best known and most studied statesmen in European history; his Spanish contemporary and rival, the Count--Duke of Olivares, one of the least known.

International History Review<br><br>"In every respect this is a remarkably clear and compact book. Above all, it is a convincing demonstration of the value of comparative history. No number of separate national or biographical histories could have achieved the integration and penetration that he has achieved by asking the same questions about each man and probing equally in both Spanish and French sources for answers to those questions. Elliott's scholarship is wide-ranging as well as meticulous, and his insights are both thoughtful and thought-provoking." American Historical Review</p><h2>The Evolution of Morality (Life and Mind: Philosophical Issues in Biology and Psychology)</h2><p><p>Moral thinking pervades our practical lives, but where did this way of thinking come from, and what purpose does it serve? Is it to be explained by environmental pressures on our ancestors a million years ago, or is it a cultural invention of more recent origin? In <i>The Evolution of Morality</i>, Richard Joyce takes up these controversial questions, finding that the evidence supports an innate basis to human morality. As a moral philosopher, Joyce is interested in whether any implications follow from this hypothesis. Might the fact that the human brain has been biologically prepared by natural selection to engage in moral judgment serve in some sense to vindicate this way of thinking&#x2015;staving off the threat of moral skepticism, or even undergirding some version of moral realism? Or if morality has an adaptive explanation in genetic terms&#x2015;if it is, as Joyce writes, "just something that helped our ancestors make more babies"&#x2015;might such an explanation actually undermine morality's central role in our lives? He carefully examines both the evolutionary "vindication of morality" and the evolutionary "debunking of morality," considering the skeptical view more seriously than have others who have treated the subject.</p><p>Interdisciplinary and combining the latest results from the empirical sciences with philosophical discussion, <i>The Evolution of Morality</i> is one of the few books in this area written from the perspective of moral philosophy. Concise and without technical jargon, the arguments are rigorous but accessible to readers from different academic backgrounds. Joyce discusses complex issues in plain language while advocating subtle and sometimes radical views. <i>The Evolution of Morality</i> lays the philosophical foundations for further research into the biological understanding of human morality.</p></p><p>Richard Joyce is Professor of Philosophy at Victoria University of Wellington and author of <i>The Evolution of Morality </i>(MIT Press, 2006) and <i>The Myth of Morality</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2001).<p>Joyce's book is brilliant. There is nothing more important than knowing what we are doing when we speak in the language of value. We are animals that judge with cognitve and affective equipment. Joyce explains who we are. Nothing matters more.</p>&#x2015;<b>Owen Flanagan</b>, James B. Duke Professor of Philosophy, Duke University<br><br><p>Morality is often considered the opposite of human nature: our main tool to keep human nature in check. Yet the moral sense likely evolved along with the rest of human sociality. Exploring this evolutionary angle, Richard Joyce provides a revealing philosopher's account of what makes us moral primates.</p>&#x2015;<b>Frans de Waal</b>, author of <i>Our Inner Ape</i><br><br><p>Why do humans not just help each other and feel bad when they harm each other but also make specifically moral judgments about helping and harming? I know of no better discussion of this central question than Joyce's admirably clear, concise, and critical survey. Joyce's answer and his arguments will challenge philosophers and move the debates to new levels.</p>&#x2015;<b>Walter Sinnott-Armstrong</b>, Professor of Philosophy and Hard Professor of Legal Studies, Dartmouth College<br><br><p>In his enjoyable and informative book <i>The Evolution of Morality</i>, Richard Joyce distinguishes between explaining how natural selection might explain socially useful behavior in animals and what more is needed to explain morality, with its thoughts about right or wrong, in human beings. Contrary to what others have said, Joyce argues plausibly that, to the extent that our moral concepts and opinions are the results of natural selection, there is no rational basis for these concepts and opinions.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gilbert Harman</b>, Department of Philosophy, Princeton University<br><br><p>This book is a tour de force, synthesizing disparate literatures into a pleasing whole. Joyce's writing is clear, articulate, and enjoyable, and his presentation masterful.</p>&#x2015;<b>William D. Casebeer</b>, Associate Professor of Philosophy, U.S. Air Force Academy</p><h2>Deleuze and Art (Bloomsbury Studies in Continental Philosophy)</h2><p><p>In <i>Deleuze and Art</i> Anne Sauvagnargues, one of the world's most renowned Deleuze scholars, offers a unique insight into the constitutive role played by art in the formation of Deleuze's thought. By reproducing Deleuze's social and intellectual references, Sauvagnargues is able to construct a precise map of the totality of Deleuze's work, pinpointing where key Deleuzian concepts first emerge and eventually disappear. This innovative methodology, which Sauvagnargues calls "periodization", provides a systematic historiography of Deleuze's philosophy that remains faithful to his affirmation of the principle of exteriority. By analyzing the external relations between Deleuze's self-proclaimed three philosophical periods, Sauvagnargues gives the reader an inside look into the conceptual and artistic landscape that surrounded Deleuze and the creation of his philosophy. </p><p>With extreme clarity and precision, Sauvagnargues provides an important glimpse into Deleuze's philosophy by reconstructing the social and intellectual contexts that contributed to the trajectory of his thought. This book is the product of insightful and careful research, which has not been made available to English readers of Deleuze before now.</p></p><p><p><b>Anne Sauvagnargues</b> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris, Nanterre, France, and specializes in the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze. She co-directs the collection &#x201c;Lignes d'art&#x201d; with Fabienne Brug�re for Presses Universitaires de France, and in 2008 she published a book on Deleuze's philosophy entitled <i>Transcendental Empiricism</i>.</p><p><b>Samantha Bankston</b> has published on 19th and 20th century European philosophy, and is the author of <i>Deleuze and Becoming</i> (Bloomsbury, 2017) and the forthcoming book, <i>Deleuze and &#x17d;i&#x17e;ek</i>.</p>Readers will be impressed with Sauvagnargues&#39; masterful grasp of Deleuze&#39;s entire oeuvre, and admire her tightly argued claims about how his aesthetics is based in empirical experimentation with material and social effects and real consequences for processes of subjectivation. * Gary Genosko, University of Ontario Institute of Technology, Canada, Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews * It is not easy to write a sober book on Deleuze. Anne Sauvagnargues, however, has achieved this difficult task. Deleuze and Art is remarkably clear, concise, systematic, and insightful. But more than sober, and a reason for jubilation, Sauvagnargues&#39; Deleuze and Art looks to be an original work of philosophy. The manner in which she maps out Deleuze&#39;s thought turns out to present a &#34;semiotics of the image&#34; that seems to open question well beyond the scope of Deleuze&#39;s own thinking. Echoing Deleuze himself, we must say that Sauvagnargues&#39; Deleuze and Art &#34;forces us to think.&#34; * Leonard Lawlor, Sparks Professor of Philosophy, Penn State University * Anne Sauvagnargues has written an incisive, clear and carefully considered introduction to Deleuze and Guattari&#39;s writings on literature and art that will no doubt become one of the authoritative texts to which readers turn for insight on their enigmatic concepts and their dynamic understanding of art. This book addresses all the key texts of Deleuze to show the nuances and developments in the concepts he, together with Guattari, invented to think art beyond the artist and as a part of the way that the world affects itself. An excellent book! * Elizabeth Grosz, Women&#39;s Studies, Duke University, USA * An original and profound book from a renowned French commentator on Gilles Deleuze! It is an essential reading for those seeking to understand the depth and complexity of Deleuze&#39;s philosophy, which Anne Sauvagnargues pursues by exploring the relationships between Deleuze&#39;s thought and art. The book shows that Deleuze&#39;s philosophy was fundamentally shaped by these relationships and that it cannot be understood, without being impoverished, if considered apart from them. An admirable achievement of thinking and scholarship, this book will remain indispensable for years to come. * Arkady Plotnitsky, Professor of English, Purdue University, USA * Anne Sauvagnargues is well-known in France as one of Deleuze&#39;s most original and incisive interpreters, and Samantha Bankston&#39;s fluid and accurate translation has at last made this important book accessible to English speaking readers. Deleuze and Art not only provides a wide-ranging analysis of Deleuze&#39;s writings on aesthetics, but uses the domain of art as a point of access into his entire philosophical system. This is a landmark text destined to become a classic in the interpretation of Deleuze&#39;s work. * Daniel W.

The author is completing a second volume, "The Period of Consolidation, 1871-1890." Volume I has been awarded the <i>McKnight Foundation Humanities Award</i>.</p></p><p>"German �migr� training and the critical involvement of the interested outsider have combined to produce some notable achievements in the American scholarship on German history prosecuted since the war, and on the basis of this first volume it can be confidently anticipated that Otto Pflanze's study of Bismarck will rank with the best of them. For here is historical biography in the approved grand manner, the public life of a major figure set solidly in the political relations and movements of the time, recounted with the judiciousness that is a blend of detachment and understanding, and presented with the articulated clarity and the modulations of gravity and whimsicality that are the marks of good writing. . . . It is now the standard authority for Bismarck's early regime."<b>---Leonard Krieger, <i>Political Science Quarterly</i></b><br><br>"By virtue of his superb mastery of the vast Bismarck literature and by his own sound historical sense, Mr. Pflanze cuts through many of the ideological controversies which have hitherto obscured rather than illuminated Bismarck. Nor is this focus narrowly biographical. Rather he seeks to grasp both the man and the forces with which he had to contend, and the result is a clear view of the interplay of German internal development with Bismarck's diplomacy and wars. . . . Mr. Pflanze's work will long endure as an excellent study of the public career of an extraordinary statesman."<b>---Fritz Stern, <i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>"This is an admirable book, a credit to American scholarship, by far the best treatment of Bismarck to appear in English. A product of the most meticulous investigation, it is beautifully researched. More than just another biography of Bismarck, it is also a perceptive history concentrating on the interaction between domestic developments and Bismarck's diplomacy and wars up to 1871."<b>---Louis L. Snyder, <i>Saturday Review</i></b><br><br>"Of the scholarly works on German history published in the United States during the decade of the 1960's, none is likely to be more enduring than the first volume of <i>Bismarck and the Development of Germany</i> by Otto Pflanze. . . .

Lee is professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.This sensitive study examines at the local level the radically transforming nature of what is often simplistically viewed as the world's most conservative revolution. In the 1760s, Charles County, Md., seemed a typically stable community: a Chesapeake society in which a Protestant male gentry expected and received deference from indentured servants, women, Roman Catholics (then disenfranchised), and slaves. Lee (History/Univ. of Wisconsin) demonstrates how, only three decades later, that world had changed utterly. The Revolutionary War sparked a hearts-and-minds effort to save the new republic, as residents made Tories unwelcome, rounded up munitions, food, and clothing, and joined the militia. With the war won, the county exhibited optimism about its commercial future and greater acceptance of previously marginalized groups. Many slaves had won freedom through lawsuits and manumission; bound labor among whites was almost eliminated; religious liberty was extended to all; women had improved their status substantially; and, of course, its inhabitants, like all others in the newly independent United States, no longer owed allegiance to a king. The toll was immense, however. Largely because of massive debt, soil depletion, and other economic dislocations caused by the war, Charles County began a period of long-term decline after 1790, with many residents departing for a new life elsewhere. By the Civil War, it had 20% fewer people than at the time of George Washington's inauguration. Lee makes excellent use of a variety of local records to explain how this society, having caught the winds of change, suddenly and ruefully discovered that those winds were of gale force. Her work vividly affirms what she calls ``the value of seeking the general through the particular--of finding in the close examination of one place the outlines of an entire era.'' An illuminating local history, reflecting an emerging nation's tribulations. (Photos and maps, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It survived barely a century, but its impact on popular imagination has been great. Beginning in the 16th century, leaders struggled to reunite the Mongol tribes and to recast the forms of their early empire in art. This renaissance produced a vast legacy of art, to which this book is devoted. The book, published to accompany a major travelling exhibition drawn from Mongolia&#39;s national museums and library, provides a view of Mongolian Buddhist life and presents, in 200 illustrations, a diverse array of treasures: opulent headdresses, radiant bronze sculptures, colourful and exotic masks, richly decorated manuscripts and book covers, and the spun-gold robes of the last &#34;Bogdo Khan&#34; (&#34;Enlightened King&#34;). An introductory text describing the birth of the Mongol culture is followed by essays exploring the rich historical background and examining the ways in which the various forms of art were used. Each photographed object is accompanied by an extended caption.</p><p>With the fall of communism, countries like Mongolia have begun to reach out to the wider world. In that spirit, this lavishly illustrated exhibition catalog presents a wide range of objects held by Mongolian museums that have been, until now, largely closed to Western scholars. A collaborative effort of the Asian Art Musuem of San Francisco and the Mongolian Ministry of Culture, National Library, and national museums, this catalog offers an excellent overview of Mongolian history, culture, and art. Each chapter of the extensive text is authored by a major scholar in this field and is accompanied by both black-and-white historical photographs and color photos of the exhibit objects. Highly recommended as a visual survey of a little-known culture for any library with interests in art and/or Asian studies.?Dr. Eugene C.

In The Halliburton Agenda, Halliburton and its subsidiaries form the foundation of a fascinating story of influence peddling and behind-the-scenes political maneuvering that has only increased in momentum over the last decade-culminating in a firestorm of problems arising as soon as Cheney took office.<br> This intriguing book shows readers where Halliburton has been doing business and with whom-topping the list so far are Iran, Iraq, and Libya. It also reveals how this juggernaut of a corporation has engaged in a cycle of profits that begins by selling products and services to potential terrorist states, contracting with the federal government during times of war against those states, then gaining valuable rebuilding contracts to help repair those states. It will also show how a Halliburton subsidiary, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, has become an indispensable part of the U.S. military, so much so that the two are indistinguishable at times.<br> Halliburton is one of the first American companies to recognize the importance of aligning itself with powerful politicians, heavily contributing to campaigns, then cashing in on lucrative government contracts. Engaging and informative, The Halliburton Agenda carefully explores the arc of the company's success, its use of political affiliation, and the scope of its international business.</p><p>Despite their shared preference for keeping a low profile, Vice President Dick Cheney and Halliburton, his former employer, gained notoriety in the aftermath of the war in Iraq thanks to a series of lucrative government contracts awarded to Halliburton, for which they never had to bid. Business journalist Dan Briody sheds light on the history of the company and demonstrates how its present-day relationship with influential politicians is not anomalous but part of a time-honored yet ethically suspect tradition of doing business. Briody introduces Erle Halliburton, who was born into poverty but found great financial success with innovative oil well technology. And while Halliburton avoided getting close to elected officials or pursuing government contracts, the Brown brothers of Texas-based Brown &amp; Root made the nurturing of "pet politicians" a top priority as they grew their construction business into one of the most powerful in the nation. <i>The Halliburton Agenda</i> details the mutually beneficial relationship the Browns shared with an up and coming Lyndon Johnson as money and influence flowed freely between the two. Halliburton acquired Brown &amp; Root in 1962 and with it, Briody contends, plenty of questionable business practices that continue to this day. Dick Cheney looms ominously on the book's cover but he doesn't appear much in the book until fairly late in the Halliburton story. Still, because Cheney's early-1990s' appointment to the job of CEO (after no private sector experience) and departure to be Vice President in 2000 coincided with an upsurge in Halliburton revenues and controversies, there's plenty of material to examine. While many have questioned what sway corporations have in the George W. Bush administration, Briody's extended look at Halliburton's corporate culture and history provides enlightening perspective. <i>--John Moe</i>During the 2000 vice presidential debate, when Dick Cheney was asked about his financial success as Halliburton&#x2019;s CEO, he responded that the government had played no role in it. But even Cheney himself couldn&#x2019;t really believe that. Halliburton has taken the idea of the military-industrial complex to a level never before seen. And in its seemingly unstoppable march to becoming the vendor of choice for the United States military, Halliburton continues to court controversy. <p>In The Halliburton Agenda, Halliburton and its subsidiary, Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, form the foundation of an intriguing story of cronyism and conflict of interest that has only increased in momentum over the last decade.</p> <p>Award-winning journalist and bestselling author Dan Briody cuts through the veil of secrecy that cloaks this controversial company, and reveals how the confluence of business and politics has led to questionable deals as well as financial windfalls for Halliburton, its executives, and its subsidiaries.</p> <p>The Halliburton Agenda digs deep to expose:</p> <ul> <li>A pattern of cost overages by the company dating as far back as World War II and extending forward through Vietnam, Somalia, and Bosnia</li> <li>How Halliburton has been doing business with terrorist states such as Libya and Iran for decades&#x2013;and why the company continues to do so</li> <li>The questionable legality of the U.S. government&#x2019;s contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, including LOGCAP&#x2013;the government&#x2019;s contract to provide logistical support to the Army&#x2013;and the contract for the work in rebuilding Iraq&#x2019;s oil infrastructure</li> <li>Why the company paid a $2.4 million bribe to a Nigerian tax official, acquired $4.4 billion of asbestos liability, and changed its accounting procedures without notifying its shareholders&#x2013;an action that has led to an ongoing SEC investigation</li> <li>The current allegations against Halliburton for overcharging the U.S. government for gas in Iraq</li> </ul> <p>Halliburton&#x2019;s inextricable links to politicians and the United States military, its dealings with countries known to sponsor terrorism, and its controversial $2 billion government contract to rebuild Iraq are only the tip of the iceberg. The Halliburton Agenda untangles a complex web of political power plays and deceptive deals&#x2013;revealing how a company with the right connections can finesse its way to success.</p></p><h2>Devil&#39;s Due (Destroyermen)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Taylor Anderson continues the thrilling Destroyermen series of alternate history and military strategy, as the conflict is about to become terrifyingly personal....</b><br><br>Captain Matt Reddy and the crew of the USS Walker have been fighting for their lives ever since their ship was swept from the Pacific to another world and they became embroiled in a deadly conflict between their Lemurian allies and the ravening Grik. <br><br>But things are about to get worse.

He'd never thought he'd miss how cold it got in Stanley, or Grand Forks, North Dakota, either. That was another place he considered home after spending half his childhood there. But it was rarely anything but hot-and wet-in Baalkpan, the capital city of the new Union he'd helped build. The daily shower had finally passed and he and his wife, Karen, the assistant minister of medicine, stepped outside the main entrance to the Allied Naval Hospital east of the Great Hall. That was Karen's principal domain, and between her long hours and his crazy schedule, Alan sometimes gloomily suspected their little daughter, Allison Verdia, was the only child they'd ever get the chance to make. But at least he could see his "youngling" and "mate," which was a hell of a lot more than most could say these days. So many younglings had at least one parent deployed, sometimes both. Alan tried to prevent the latter, but that had been a losing proposition from the start. Lemurians made no distinction between sexes when it came to military service, and that was probably the only reason they'd had the numbers to survive. But new regulations decreed that pregnant females returned home, period, and he tried to keep them as trainers as long as possible.<br><br> Even so, there were a lot of orphans running around. The youngest went entirely naked, scampering about on all fours as often as not, their frizzy tails held high. A pack of them dashed through a puddle, splashing water and mud, before rocketing up a heavy wooden pier supporting an old-style aboveground structure built in the time before genuine fortifications protected the city from large predators-and invading Grik. The younglings flowed through a window, raising alarmed, angry voices, then skittered down another pier to vanish in the bustle of the city. Alan laughed at the sight, but supposed it wasn't really funny. Lemurian younglings were boisterous by nature and their antics were well tolerated by adults. In the past, however, they'd been equally well supervised. That was no longer the case, and they now ran in packs almost as wild as Griklets. Alan tried to be philosophical about it. At least they didn't swarm all over people and eat them like Griklets. But even as they were losing an entire generation to the war, Alan feared they might lose the next one, too. Culturally, at least.<br><br> "Mind your shoes," Karen scolded, as Alan carefully negotiated the planks laid down to the paalka-drawn carriage outside the hospital. "And at least try to keep from making mud pies in your best whites! Maybe I don't have to clean them anymore"-she flapped her own clean but dark-stained apron for emphasis-"but somebody does. And it's a chore nobody needs!"<br><br> Alan had been caught by the rain while visiting wounded 'Cats and men; something he did every week. And he didn't mind that the deluge had delayed his busy schedule, heartrending as it often was to speak with the shattered victims of this terrible war, or simply view those who couldn't even hear him. It also filled him with hope that, despite their pain, so many Lemurians-and humans from the Empire of the New Britain Isles, for the most part-remained so dedicated to the cause. Indeed, most were eager to return to the fight, regardless of how . . . unlikely that might be in many cases. They'll get back in somehow, Alan promised himself-as he'd promised them-even if they never see the front again. We need instructors, engineers, and shop foremen who've been at the pointy end and seen what works. We may've lost their direct combat skills, but we can't afford to lose their experience. God knows we need them.<br><br> "I'll try," Alan assured, stepping into the carriage and nodding at the 'Cat Marine on the front seat, holding the reins. The Lemurian made a curious chirping sound and whipped the reins. Moaning rebelliously, the paalka squished forward. Alan swayed, still looking at Karen and the hospital behind her. The hospital wasn't as large as the great factories now crowding the Baalkpan waterfront, once so charming with colorful, bustling bazaars and brisk commerce, but it was the biggest building past the Great Hall, in Baalkpan proper. That was a source of pride, as well as sadness. It said a lot about how committed "his" people were to helping those who served them. His expression turned stony then, because as much as his visits to the hospital inspired him, they also renewed his resolve to exact vengeance against those who'd caused so much suffering in the first place. All of them, he secretly swore, with a fresh stab of furious grief over the sinking of SMS Amerika, and two- thirds of the wounded she carried, by the shadowy League of Tripoli. Some of Amerika's survivors had finally reached Baalkpan, and between their accounts and what Matt sent from Grik City, they had a better idea of what happened-and of what the League was, even if its motives remained obscure. Three wars now? Alan mused grimly. No, not yet. Not if we can help it. We can barely handle the two we've got. But there'll be a reckoning.<br><br> "And put on your hat!" Karen admonished, raising her voice and gesturing at the sky. The sun was stabbing through the clouds, raising steam from the sodden ground. Alan Letts had a very fair complexion and burned easily. He didn't spend as much time outdoors these days and sometimes forgot to protect himself.<br><br> "Yes, dear," he called back dutifully, quickly adjusting his high, tight collar and plopping the white hat on his head. "I'll see you and the girls tonight," he added, finally sitting as the carriage lurched onto the main, gravel-mixed street. For all the younglings running loose, even more had been adopted by females working in the shipyards or factories, both Lemurians and expat Imperial women. Some families with the wherewithal, still intact because they ran businesses essential to the war effort and weren't allowed to fight, had adopted half a dozen or more. Alan and Karen had taken two themselves, both female, and treated them as their own. They would've taken more, but their duties already required that they have a nanny-a young, one-armed Marine veteran of the Battle of Raan-goon named Unaa-Saan-Mar-with three younglings of her own. For the first time, he noticed the many furry Lemurian faces watching from the newly built ground-level shops and porches lining the road, their amused but respectful blinking still coming as a surprise.<br><br> They actually enjoy that I'm henpecked! He realized with a mental snort. Then he reconsidered. But maybe that's why they've accepted me. It makes me more a person to them, regardless of what . . . species I am. Alan still found his official status as the leader of the new, wildly diverse nation they'd built a bit overwhelming, and more than a little unbelievable. True, he'd been accepted as acting chairman during Adar's absence, and the members of the Grand Alliance, including the Empire of the New Britain Isles and the Republic of Real People, which hadn't joined the Union, were accustomed to that. He even thought he'd done a good job, under the circumstances, managing the logistical side of the war effort in particular. But he'd never dreamed he'd be practically drafted into the job for real, after Adar fell into enemy hands.<br><br> It might've been easier to understand if he'd just been acclaimed High Chief of Baalkpan. He was well-known there, and even-as were all his surviving shipmates from USS Walker, USS Mahan, and S-19, to various degrees-beloved. They'd saved the city, after all. But the fact they'd also, literally or by extension, saved Aryaal, B'mbaado, B'taava, North Borno, Sembaakpan, Sular, Austraal, Chill-Chaap, the Shogunate of Yokohama (which included the tragic village of Ani-Aaki), and all the Filpin Lands-not to mention the eleven seagoing Homes that had joined the Union-apparently hadn't been lost on anyone. Though still amazingly fractious (particularly in the case of Sular, which still argued over representation after all the seagoing Homes joined as a single, relatively high-population state), the various Homes had apparently recognized the validity of some version of the old axiom "Never change horses in the middle of the stream." Or war.<br><br> It also probably helped that Alan came from the one Home or Clan that every other had to materially support and considered most impartial: the "Amer-i-caan Navy Clan." It not only protected everyone, but most of its members now came from every clan or Home. They swore allegiance to its flag and a constitution that had served as a guide for the one adopted by the Union, but though their loyalty to its high chief-Captain Matthew Reddy-was unquestioned, everyone knew they remained loyal to the United Homes as well. In addition, every Union warship belonged to the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan except those designated as reserve, such as Salaama-Na or Salissa (CV-1), and an increasing number of auxiliaries entering service. It was no longer required that all sailors join the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan forever, but officers must in order to be commissioned. Regular sailors' oaths would be allowed to expire (if they wanted) when the war was over and they went home. But the Marines practically belonged to Captain Reddy. The Navy Clan also had a few land possessions, such as the islands of Tarakaan, Midway, and Andamaan. And there was a "daughter" colony being built at a place it called Saan Diego, so far away that it was literally on the bottom of the world as far as most were concerned. Even that didn't cause disputes, because all contributed solely to the maintenance of the navy and would never become independent Homes.<br><br> Alan often wondered to himself if the mishmash they'd put together would survive the war. He also worried that the unusual powers he'd helped reserve for the Navy Clan might be abused by some future high chief after they were gone. He hoped not. He hoped the tradition of selfless service Matt and the others had established at such a terrible cost would last a very long time. Either way, though, for now at least, the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan-as the one most responsible for the conduct of the war-had to remain a very slight "first among equals," even as it truly was viewed as the most neutral when it came to disputes among other Homes.<br><br> He stuck two fingers in the collar at his neck and pulled. Damn thing's getting tighter as I sweat! he grumped to himself. What the hell was wrong with my khakis? It was his wife's idea that he always wear his best whites in public. Despite his complaints, he supposed it made sense. He was the chairman-practically president, for God's sake!-after all. He should try to look the part. And at least whites don't show sweat like khakis, he conceded. But maybe most important, the uniform's a good recruiting tool. We need more people than ever to crew the ships and fly the planes we're building, and fill the ranks of our armies.<br><br> Conscription had been instituted in the Empire of the New Britain Isles, and now in the Republic of Real People as well. But nothing like that had been proposed in the Homes forming the new Union simply because, once the war practically surrounded them, there was no place left for "runaways" to go. Particularly after the battles of Aryaal and Baalkpan. That was when it was driven brutally home that there weren't any noncombatants and it became understood that every person, male or female, capable of bearing arms and living under the protection of the Alliance from the Malay Barrier to the Filpin Lands, was a member of a local guard. Even factory workers attended daily drill sessions (usually at work) and fell in for larger unit instruction once a month in the open killing grounds beyond the ever-expanding earthen walls protecting the cities. Armories stocked with old-style muskets were conveniently situated and factory and yard workers were assigned defensive positions close to where they worked.<br><br> That was all well and good, but though anyone was theoretically subject to being called up and sent to an Advanced Training Center and assigned to a building regiment, or shipped off to replace casualties, it almost never happened. They needed workers as badly as troops. The addition of the Great South Isle, or Austraal, to the Union would help a great deal-eventually. The populous Homes there had remained an untapped reservoir of potential sailors, soldiers, and labor for most of the war. Now they were in it, and though most had to stay and build their own factories and defend their cities, many wanted to fight for their people-and their new nation. Getting them here-or anywhere-was a major problem, however. The Allied sea-lift capacity was stretched to the breaking point, supplying forces in the east and west, halfway around the world. And Austraal didn't have the same nautical mind-set of other Homes in the Union. Their huge island was lush and fertile (on this world) and never depended as much on the sea. They had a few decent shipyards, but it was taking time for them to gear up-and there was no point in building more old-style ships like they were used to, in any event. They'd agreed to focus on heavy haulers and auxiliaries, based on the hull design of the Scott class steam frigates, but half again as big. In the meantime, Allied seagoing Homes ponderously freighted steam engines down to Austraal shipyards, and just as tediously returned with loads of volunteers. Alan considered it his duty to, by example, get those recruits to choose the Navy or Marines. Besides, he thought, wearing the uniform lets me remind everyone that I belong to the Amer-i-caan Navy Clan, and, chairman or not, whether I currently outrank him or not, Captain Reddy's still my high chief.<br><br> The carriage slowed as it passed the growing military cemetery on the shady grounds surrounding the Great Hall, and finally stopped. The Great Hall was once supported high in the air by the massive Galla tree growing up within it, but had "expanded" down to the ground. Alan was running late for his rendezvous with Lord Bolton Forester, ambassador from the Empire of the New Britain Isles, but the tall, gray-haired man with a huge mustache stood from a bench on the hall's porch and smiled up at Alan. Forester's aide, Lieutenant Bachman, had been pacing on the carefully fitted timbers, watched by a relatively short and wiry, and also apparently amused, man named Henry Stokes. Stokes had been a leading seaman aboard HMAS Perth, and was now Director of the Office of Strategic Intelligence (OSI). Alan remained in the carriage as a pair of Lemurian Marines escorted the men to join him, ready to assist them up if necessary.</p><h2>The Oxford Starter German Dictionary</h2><p><em>The Oxford Starter German Dictionary</em> provides essential information in a totally new way.

The second in a trilogy of Universe stories - the first being <i>Born with a Bang: The Universe Tells Our Cosmic Story</i>-- this book picks up the story with the first appearance of life on Earth. It's a thrilling story about how Earth triumphs over crisis to become bacteria, jellyfish, flowers . . . even dinosaurs! The author, Jennifer Morgan, studied evolutionary science and saw its storytelling possibilities when she explained it to her elementary-age son. Coupled with brilliant artwork by Dana Anderson, who also studied Cosmology, these books will intrigue children and adults alike with their storytelling style and colorful pages.</p><p>Jennifer Morgan's work as a storyteller, author, educator and environmental advocate flows out of her love of the natural world and cosmology. As former director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New Jersey, she started numerous educational and marketing programs for farmers and consumers, both locally and nationally. Currently she is an adjunct staff member at Genesis Farm, teaching the Sacred Universe Story. A portion of Ms. Morgan&#x2019;s royalties from the sale of this book are donated to earth literacy centers. Her storytelling evolved from bedtime stories for her son who wanted to know more and more, even the texture of the edge of the Universe. She believes that our cosmology stories fundamentally shape us, our relationships, our work, our play, our culture, our institutions, our everything. Jennifer is also the author of <b>Born With A Bang: The Universe Tells Our Cosmic Story</b>. <p>Dana Lynne Andersen, M.A., is a multi-media artist, playwright and teacher with degrees in philosophy and consciousness studies. Her paintings, often very large in size, explore the swirling forces of energy that underlie matter and seek to reveal life's numinous mystery. She believes that as our "depth perception" expands - billions of galaxies discovered in our lifetime! - it is also essential to expand perception inwardly to the vastness within. She is founder of Awakening Arts, a network of artists who "affirm the noble purpose of art as a vehicle for uplifting the human spirit.Dana is also the illustrator of <b>Born With A Bang: The Universe Tells Our Cosmic Story</b></p>". . .

When Erasmus failed to find the comma in the Greek manuscripts he used for his New Testament edition, he omitted it. Accused of promoting Antitrinitarian heresy, Erasmus included the comma in his third edition (1522) after seeing it in a Greek codex from England, even though he suspected the manuscript&#39;s authenticity. The resulting disputes, involving leading theologians, philologists and controversialists such as Luther, Calvin, Sozzini, Milton, Newton, Bentley, Gibbon and Porson, touched not simply on philological questions, but also on matters of doctrine, morality, social order, and toleration. While the spuriousness of the Johannine comma was established by 1900, it has again assumed iconic status in recent attempts to defend biblical inerrancy amongst the Christian Right. A social history of the Johannine comma thus provides significant insights into the recent culture wars.</p><p>This book explores the explosive social and political implications of Erasmus&#39; philological work on the Greek New Testament. When Erasmus (1516) failed to find Greek manuscript evidence for the &#39;Johannine comma&#39;, long considered the clearest biblical evidence for the Trinity, he unwittingly opened a vicious debate over the nature of the bible, its relationship with doctrine, and the role of the state in regulating private belief.Grantley McDonald is a postdoctoral fellow at the Universit�t Wien, and leader of the research project &#39;The Court Chapel of Maximilian I: Between Art and Politics&#39;.

To this day, many people consider it the best book ever written about Cape Cod. This new illustrated volume features the complete text of Thoreau&#x2019;s classic work as published in Houghton Mifflin&#x2019;s 1906 edition, the stunning photography of Scot Miller, and a foreword from the preeminent Thoreau biographer, Robert Richardson. Many of the lush color photographs show elements of the landscape that Thoreau would have seen: the great beach, imposing cliffs, sand dunes, beautiful sunrises and sunsets, beach grass, seaweed; others reflect the unique personality of Cape Cod and its people today, including local artists and architecture. The combination of Thoreau&#x2019;s timeless text and Miller&#x2019;s exquisitely reproduced color photographs make this an indispensable book for anyone who loves Thoreau&#x2019;s writing or Cape Cod.<br><br>The book is being published in association with the Walden Woods Project, which is dedicated to preserving the lands Thoreau wrote about.

Larry Siedentop argues instead that liberal thought is, in its underlying assumptions, the offspring of the Church. Beginning with a moral revolution in the first centuries CE, when notions about equality and human agency were first formulated by St. Paul, Siedentop follows these concepts in Christianity from Augustine to the philosophers and canon lawyers of the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, and ends with their reemergence in secularism&#x2015;another of Christianity&#x2019;s gifts to the West.<i></i></p><p><i>Inventing the Individual</i> tells how a new, equal social role, the individual, arose and gradually displaced the claims of family, tribe, and caste as the basis of social organization. Asking us to rethink the evolution of ideas on which Western societies and government are built, Siedentop contends that the core of what is now the West&#x2019;s system of beliefs emerged earlier than we commonly think. The roots of liberalism&#x2015;belief in individual freedom, in the fundamental moral equality of individuals, in a legal system based on equality, and in a representative form of government befitting a society of free people&#x2015;all these were pioneered by Christian thinkers of the Middle Ages who drew on the moral revolution carried out by the early Church. These philosophers and canon lawyers, not the Renaissance humanists, laid the foundation for liberal democracy in the West.</p></p><p>Larry Siedentop is Emeritus Fellow of Keble College, Oxford.It is a magnificent work of intellectual, psychological and spiritual history. It is hard to decide which is more remarkable: the breadth of learning displayed on almost every page, the infectious enthusiasm that suffuses the whole book, the riveting originality of the central argument or the emotional power and force with which it is deployed. <b>Siedentop</b> takes us on a 2,000-year journey that starts with the almost inconceivably remote city states of the ancient world and ends with the Renaissance. In the course of this journey, he explodes many (perhaps even most) of the preconceptions that run through the public culture of our day&#x2015;and that I took for granted before reading his book. <i>Inventing the Individual</i> is not an exercise in dry-as-dust antiquarianism, still less in pop-historical fun and games. Siedentop&#x2019;s aim has a breathtaking grandeur about it: to persuade us to ask ourselves who we are and where we are going by showing us where we have come from. A challenging epilogue suggests that the answers are not very flattering. (David Marquand <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>Like the best books, <i>Inventing the Individual </i>both teaches you something new and makes you want to argue with it. (Kenan Malik <i>The Independent</i>)<br><br>In this learned, subtle, enjoyable and digestible work [<b>Siedentop</b>] has offered back to us a proper version of ourselves. He has explained us to ourselves... [A] magisterial, timeless yet timely work. (Douglas Murray <i>The Spectator</i>)<br><br>A most impressive work of philosophical history. (Robert Skidelsky)<br><br>With <i>Inventing the Individual</i>, <b>Siedentop</b> is not trying to reveal a hidden or suppressed religious impulse in Western modernity but rather attempting to trace a lost genealogy. He sees modern secularism, and its freedoms, as Christianity&#x2019;s gift to human society. (David Gress <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>In his brilliant book <i>Inventing the Individual</i>, <b>Larry Siedentop</b> paints a vivid portrait of the closed world of pagan antiquity. (Matthew J. Franck <i>First Things</i>)<br><br>[<b>Siedentop</b>] has produced what amounts to a high-altitude survey of Western ideas, meant to show that the ideal of the autonomous individual and the fact of a pluralistic civil society are both in important respects outgrowths of Christianity...Larry Siedentop has written a philosophical history in the spirit of Voltaire, Condorcet, Hegel, and Guizot. Serious scholars of history will always pick holes in these works. Yet at their most cogent and pointed, such frankly polemical metanarratives of human history help us to understand better not just the history of the present (to borrow a phrase), but also ourselves. At a time when we on the left need to be stirred from our dogmatic slumbers, <i>Inventing the Individual </i>is a reminder of some core values that are pretty widely shared. (James Miller <i>The Nation</i>)<br><br><b>Siedentop</b>&#x2019;s argument should change the way we look at both the Middle Ages and the formation of the modern nation-state.

Delving into an array of manuscript sources, Loudon examines their social and economic status, their background and training, their scientific methods and medical challenges, and their patients and pay-scales.

In The Constitution of Society he outlines the distinctive position he has evolved during that period and offers a full statement of a major new perspective in social thought, a synthesis and elaboration of ideas touched on in previous works but described here for the first time in an integrated and comprehensive form. A particular feature is Giddens&#39;s concern to connect abstract problems of theory to an interpretation of the nature of empirical method in the social sciences. In presenting his own ideas, Giddens mounts a critical attack on some of the more orthodox sociological views.

A feast for the eyes and other visceral zones, Trash rolls in the mud with graphic art of such questionable aesthetic quality and social worth that it practically redefines the poster as advertising medium. Chapters each define a key Trash topic (Sex Trash, Action Trash, Sick Trash, Race Trash, Groovy Trash, Docu Trash), collecting the most zombified, oversexed, lethal pest-infested, and tasteless posters from each genre. With plagues of frogs, meteors headed straight for earth, sex-starved zombies, and explosion after glorious explosion, Trash gleefully crawls across the underbelly of both the cinematic and poster arts.</p><p>Jacques Boyreau co-founded the half-bar, half-underground cinema known as the Werepad. His archive, Cosmic Hex, contains hundreds of cult, horror, and sci-fi films, as well as thousands of movie posters. He lives in San Francisco.The saying oges that one man's trash is another's treasure. Then there's <i>Trash</i>, a treasure chest of exploitation movie poster art assembled by Jacques Boyreau and published by Chronicle Books ($19.95). <br> You don't have to have seen the movies to enjoy the gaudy graphics and pure bad taste in <i>Trash</i>; if you've seen more than a handful of them, you might want to seek professional help. You don't even have to know what an exploitation movies is (loosely defined, it's a cheaply made movie that addresses a hot topic with reckless abandon). Just bring a dark sense of humor and an appreciation for kitsch. <br>Many of the posters in <i>Trash</i> may make you laugh and cringe at the same time. <p>Take the poster for <i>Corruption</i> (1968). The color art shows three corpses lying in a bedroom with smoke streaming in from the edges. Then there's the ad copy, scrawled in what looks like black and red crayon: "Corruption is not a woman's picture! Therefore: No Woman Will Be Admitted Alone To See This Super-Shock Film!!" It's sexism and violence all rolled into one, the epitome of trash marketing. </p><p>Of course the more blatant sexploitation came in the form of large-breasted she-killers. <i>Hustler Squad</i> (1976) certainly owed a debt to Russ Meyer. The poster shows a bevy of buxom, barely dressed women pumping lead into their male adversaries. "Professionals...You Pay For The Pleasure, The Killing Is Free!" reads the copy. Like the current movie marketing departments that quote "critics," trash posters had a real thing for exclamation points. <br>And no exploitation display would be complete without blaxploitation, the genre that helped lift Hollywood out of deep financial crisis in the early '70s. Blaxploitation was so big that it even crossed over to Mexico: The poster for <i>El Salvaje Negro</i> shows a black man dressed in black with an orange poncho, blasting a flame-thrower into the air as - guess who? - buxom beauties fire their machine guns in the background. <br>As offensive as you may find them, such posters now serve as telling artifacts from a time when political correctness wasn't yet on the radar. They also contain a surprising number of big and at least somewhat reputable names: Al Pacino (<i>The Panic in Needle Park</i>), Quincy Jones (<i>Honky</i>), Jackie Gleason (<i>Skidoo</i>), Boris Karloff (<i>The Sorcerers</i>) and Southfork's own Larry Hagman (<i>Son of Blob</i>) are all present and accounted for, even if they'd rather that you didn't know. </p><p>Rest assured that they all got paid, because money was ultimately what exploitation movies were all about. Cheap thrills ahve always made long green. If you need a contemporary reminder, just watch reality TV. -<b>The Dallas Morning News</b> </p><p>Boyreau, co-owner of San Francisco's Weredpad, an underground movie theater/cinema archive, has edited together a coffee table edition that reprints and notates more than 150 of the loudest, gaudiest and cheapest-looking movie posters ever created. Covering pulp cinema from the '50s all the way to the '80s, these outlandish one-sheets represent a cross-section of art from the "trashiest" films ever created. The collection revels in all kinds of alternative cinema, from zombie gore-fests to scantily clad women's prison movies - from nuns in biker gangs to the scientific horrow of oversized bugs. <br>Depending on your point of view, <i>Trash</i> is either a celebration of the visceral power of baroque popular culture or an indictment of raunchy forms of media that play to the lowest common denominator. <br>Either way, you can't tear your eyes away from it. -<b>Cinescape</b></p></p><h2>The Cooking Book: Fostering Young Children&#39;s Learning and Delight</h2><p>INVITES TEACHERS TO THE TABLE, TO CREATE TASTY PROJECTS WITH CHILDREN AND ALSO LEARN SCIENCE, MATH, AND LITERACY SKILLS; WITH KID-TESTED RECIPES.</p><p></p><h2>The Inquisition in New Spain, 1536&#x2013;1820: A Documentary History</h2><p><p>The Inquisition!

White Tower, the pioneering hamburger chain founded in 1926, never felt the need for this kind of advertising; it depended on its instantly recognizable building to say it all. Those gleaming white (&#x201c;clean&#x201d;), well-lighted (&#x201c;always open&#x201d;), streamlined (&#x201c;fast and efficient&#x201d;), human-scaled (&#x201c;friendly&#x201d;) structures were three-dimensional billboards for their franchise, capped by an actual white tower often redundantly labeled, in bold graphics, &#x201c;White Tower.&#x201d; This was branding before the age of branding. The photographs in this classic book not only trace the evolution of a restaurant chain, they record an iconography of a part of the American built environment that no longer exists. In an approach very much in the spirit of Learning from Las Vegas, by Venturi, Scott Brown, and Izenour, architects Paul Hirshorn and Steven Izenour have selected photographs taken in a variety of styles&#x2015;from the stark and deadpan to family album-like snapshots. In an affectionately written introductory essay, Hirshorn and Izenour describe the identifiable and idiosyncratic commercial architectural style of the 1930s and 1940s and document the development of the White Tower buildings and their stylistic variations. Their conversations with former White Tower employees&#x2015;including Charles Johnson, White Tower's architect for over forty years&#x2015;are the source of many telling quotations and entertaining captions that set their analysis of the buildings within a broader story of corporate culture, mass marketing, and the rise of franchising in the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Paul Hirshorn has been Head of the Department of Architecture at Drexel University since 1986, and a member of the faculty since 1974. He had previously worked for the Philadelphia firms of Venturi &amp; Rauch and Ueland &amp; Junker.<p>A paean to nickel burgers and the men who sold them. The two authors, both at one time associated with Robert Venturi, have taken a single element out of the urban strip treated in Learning from Las Vegasthe hamburger jointand analyzed its permutations.... <i>White Towers</i> combines provocative thinking about corporate use of architectural symbolism with a series of startlingly beautiful photographs.</p>&#x2015;<i>The Nation</i><br><br><p>Hirshhorn and Izenour's slender, modest sized format book, first published in 1979... is a glorious celebration of architecture, design iconography and proxemics all beautifully depicted in black and white photographs.</p>&#x2015;<i>New York-Pennsylvania Collector</i><br><br><p><i>White Towers</i> provides a stylish and nostalgic view of the beginnings of the fast-food industry.... From its beginnings in the 1920s to the present day, <i>White Towers</i> treats this pop emblem of American iconography in a justifiably serious yet amusing manner.</p>&#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br><p>In 1970 Paul Hirschorn and Steven Izenour, young architects in the office of Venturi and Rauch, sensed 'roadside awareness... in the air.' As they traveled... they noticed the 'gleaming little white buildings' of the White Tower eateries and began to photograph them. Their interest grew serious when a chance conversation at a Camden, New Jersey, White Tower counter led them to Charles J. Johnson, the chain's principal architect. Given access to the firm's records and photographic archives, the two decided to collaborate on a serious study of the design of the White Tower. What emerged is a fascinating case study of a commercial building type.</p>&#x2015;<b>Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz</b>, <i>Landscape</i><br><br><p>The authors like these buildings, and they like them without illusions. They understand how inventive the architects of White Towers were in molding the imagery of a tiny white castle into a variety of different shapes and forms, and we end up realizing what a pleasing body of work this collection of buildings isbest of all in the late thirties, when every White Tower was an earnest little gem of Art Moderne.</p>&#x2015;<b>Paul Goldberger</b>, <i>The New York Times</i></p><h2>Color Workbook</h2><p><p>This workbook presents a diverse conceptual overview of color theory coupled with numerous studies and activities to solidify students&#x2019; understanding of design and color concepts through hands-on experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This workbook&nbsp;combines both a formal and content-oriented approach to color with students, allowing them to use it both technically and as an expressive tool.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>As a practicing artist and an art educator, Becky Koenig has possessed a lifelong desire to master color.

G. Wells, the father of science fiction.<br><br><i>The Time Machine</i> conveys the Time Traveller into the distant future and an extraordinary world. There, stranded on a slowly dying Earth, he discovers two bizarre races: the effete Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks&#x2014;a haunting portrayal of Darwin&#x2019;s evolutionary theory carried to a terrible conclusion.<br><br><i>The Invisible Man </i>is the fascinating tale of a brash young scientist who, experimenting on himself, becomes invisible and then criminally insane, trapped in the terror of his own creation.<br><br>Convincing and unforgettably real, these two classics are consummate representations of the stories that defined science fiction&#x2014;and inspired generations of readers and writers.<br><br>With an Introduction by John Calvin Batchelor<br>and an Afterword by Paul Youngquist</p><p><b>Herbert George Wells </b>(1866&#x2013;1946) was born in Bromley, Kent, England. His father was a professional cricketer and sometime shopkeeper, his mother a former lady&#x2019;s maid. Although &#x201c;Bertie&#x201d; left school at fourteen to become a draper&#x2019;s apprentice (a life he detested), he later won a scholarship to the Normal School of Science in London, where he studied with the famous Thomas Henry Huxley. He began to sell articles and short stories regularly in 1893. In 1895, his immediately successful novel <i>The Time Machine</i> rescued him from a life of penury on a schoolteacher&#x2019;s salary. His other &#x201c;scientific romances&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i> (1896), <i>The Invisible Man </i>(1897), <i>The War of the Worlds </i>(1898), <i>The First Men in the Moon </i>(1901), and <i>The War in the Air </i>(1908)&#x2014;won him distinction as the father of science fiction. Henry James saw in Wells the most gifted writer of the age, but Wells, having coined the phrase &#x201c;the war that will end war&#x201d; to describe World War I, became increasingly disillusioned and focused his attention on educating mankind with his bestselling <i>Outline of History</i> (1920) and his later utopian works. Wells witnessed a world more terrible than any of his imaginative visions, and he bitterly observed: &#x201c;Reality has taken a leaf from my book and set itself to supercede me.&#x201d;<br><br><b>John Calvin Batchelor </b>is the acclaimed author of such imaginative novels as <i>The American Falls</i>, <i>People&#x2019;s Republic of Antarctica</i>, and <i>Gordon Liddy Is My Muse.</i><br><br><b>Paul Youngquist </b>is professor of English and associate chair of Graduate Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder. He&#x2019;s the author of three books: <i>Race, Romanticism, and The Atlantic</i>; <i>Madness and Blake&#x2019;s Myth</i> (1991); and <i>Monstrosities: Bodies and British Romanticism </i>(2003), as well as numerous articles on a variety of subjects.<b>From Alfred Mac Adam&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Time Machine and The Invisible Man</i></b> <br><br><i>The Time Machine</i> (1895) and <i>The Invisible Man</i> (1897) are now more than a century old. Yet they endure as literary texts, radio plays, and movies, because they appeal directly to two of our deepest desires: immortality and omnipotence. The time machine would allow us to escape death and gain knowledge of the fate of the earth, while invisibility would enable us to go and come as we please, under the noses of friends and enemies. At the same time, both fictions show us the dangers of fulfilled wishes: The Time Traveller discovers the future of humanity is not bright but hideously dark, while the Invisible Man drowns in the madness brought about by his own experimentation.<br>Of course, what Herbert George Wells (1866&#x2013;1946) wanted to express in these fantasies and what generations of readers have made of them are two radically different things. Erroneously labeled &#x201c;science fiction,&#x201d; and tricked out in their film versions with all kinds of fanciful devices with flashing lights and ominous buzzers Wells never mentions, they are really tales that enact the author&#x2019;s theories and speculations about human society, human nature, and natural history in allegorical fashion. That is, the &#x201c;science&#x201d; in Wells&#x2019;s fictions is nothing more than stage machinery. But, ironically, it is the machinery that has come to dominate our collective imagination.<br>There is nothing unique in this. Think of <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i> (whose long-forgotten original title is <i>Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World</i>), a book that Wells read as a boy and reread throughout his life. In 1726 Jonathan Swift (1667&#x2013;1745) satirized English political parties, religious quarrels, theories of world government, and science, but his work was so grounded in eighteenth-century British culture that today&#x2019;s readers need extensive preparation to fathom it. The story of Lemuel Gulliver&#x2019;s visits to lands populated by giants or intelligent horses has, however, become a staple of children&#x2019;s literature. The same applies to <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> (1719), by Daniel Defoe (1660&#x2013;1731). Only scholars see the relationship between Crusoe&#x2019;s shipwreck and Defoe&#x2019;s ideas on the fate of the middle classes during the Restoration, when Charles II returned to England in 1660. Defoe&#x2019;s message and all his political intentions have been lost, but his story endures as a wonderful demonstration of self-reliance. In the literature of the United States, we have the example of Herman Melville (1819&#x2013;1891) and his <i>Moby-Dick</i> (1851): Most readers learn about the ambiguous struggle between good and evil embedded in the work long after they&#x2019;ve read a novel about nineteenth-century whaling and the strange characters engaged in that dangerous work.<br>Much the same has taken place with Wells&#x2019;s <i>Time Machine</i> and <i>The Invisible Man</i>. Wells cloaked his ideas about the future of society and the role of science in the world so well that readers simply do not see those issues and instead read his short novels as examples of a kind of fiction based on the simplest of propositions: &#x201c;What if it were possible to travel through time by means of a machine?&#x201d; or &#x201c;What if it were possible to make oneself invisible?&#x201d; In a world&#x2014;one we share with Wells despite the fact that more than a hundred years separates the moment he published these two works from our own age&#x2014;when scientists seem to make discoveries every day, it requires no great leap of imagination, no &#x201c;willing suspension of disbelief,&#x201d; to accept the basic premise of each text.<br>This is what differentiates Wells from Jules Verne (1828&#x2013;1905), author of <i>Voyage to the Center of the Earth</i> (1864) and <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> (1873). Wells, in a 1934 preface to a collection of his early fictions comments on why they are not comparable to Verne&#x2019;s writings: <br><br>These tales have been compared with the work of Jules Verne and there was a disposition on the part of literary journalists at one time to call me the English Jules Verne. As a matter of fact there is no literary resemblance whatever between the anticipatory inventions of the great Frenchman and these fantasies. His work dealt almost always with actual possibilities of invention and discovery, and he made some remarkable forecasts. . . . But these stories of mine . . . do not pretend to deal with possible things; they are exercises of the imagination in a quite different field. They belong to a class of writing which includes the <i>Golden Ass of Apuleius</i>, the <i>True Histories of Lucian</i>, <i>Peter Schlemil</i>, and the story of <i>Frankenstein</i>. . . . They are all fantasies; they do not aim to project a serious possibility; they aim indeed only at the same amount of conviction as one gets in a good gripping dream (<i>The Complete Science Fiction Treasury of H. G. Wells</i>). <br><br>Wells links himself to a tradition, but at the same time he misleads the reader.

The difference between quantity and quality is a factor of 10. The difference in levels of engagement is exponential. People functioning at the highest level are what the authors call 10x leaders. Research on these leaders consistently brought up five major strengths. This book teaches readers to become a 10x leader using these five key areas, the SHARP framework.</p> <p>&#x25cf;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Strengths</b>: <b>10X</b> leaders stop trying to eliminate weaknesses and <i>learn to focus on their strengths </i></p> <p>&#x25cf;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Health</b>: <b>10X</b> leaders stop trying to eliminate stress and <i>learn how to integrate periods of restoration </i></p> <p>&#x25cf;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Absorption</b>: <b>10X</b> leaders stop waiting for the lightning of focus and creativity to strike and <i>learn how to achieve consistent engagement and presence</i></p> <p>&#x25cf;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Relationships</b>: <b>10X</b> leaders stop trying to exert power and control and <i>learn to cultivate healthy relationships through positivity and authenticity </i></p> <p>&#x25cf;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Purpose</b>: <b>10X</b> leaders stop grinding out tasks and <i>learn how to find meaning and commitment in everything they do</i></p> <p>The 10X elixir of peak performance comes not from focusing on just one of these areas, but from learning to light the fire of all five aspects of SHARP and functioning naturally with them on a daily basis. If you just cultivate one or two aspects of leadership skills you are unlikely to succeed. If one of the five isn&#x2019;t taken care of it affects the performance of the whole. But if you focus on all five areas, you will not only be more likely to find what helps you most, you have the best chance of enjoying the synergy of performance multiplication.</p></p><p><p><b>Tal Ben-Shahar</b> <b>(www.potentialife.com; Israel)</b> is a speaker and author of the international best sellers <i>Happier</i> and <i>Being Happy</i>.

However, legal interest in this field has remained relatively underdeveloped, and few scholars have addressed emerging legal issues to any significant degree. This collection of contributions by leading writers in the field of ethnic migration and diaspora studies therefore provides some important interdisciplinary perspectives of how ethnic/diasporic minorities in British and European contexts interact with the official legal system. This volume makes a significant contribution in assessing the role of law in current debates on the integration of ethnic and religious minorities of migrant origin in the EU. The chapters derive from papers first delivered at a lecture series on &#39;Cultural Diversity and Law&#39; at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies. The contributors&#39; disciplinary interests range across law, anthropology, sociology, geography and political theory, and each one addresses the issues within his or her field of study by adopting approaches that place law within its wider social and political context. The topics covered range from a number of &#39;public&#39; and &#39;private&#39; law issues as well as the more conceptual realms of jurisprudence. They include marriage laws, approaches to dispute resolution, the role of courts and juries in the criminal justice system, drugs policies and the criminalisation of minorities, free speech and blasphemy, planning laws and the construction of religious buildings, composition of the judiciary, the normative foundations of cultural diversity in law, and integration and law. The compilation should therefore attract an interest beyond its core readership in law, making legal issues accessible to a whole range of students and policy makers within the social sciences.</p><p></p><h2>Dinosaurs!

His innovative application of the method of political economy was a prime contributor to shifting the paradigm for rendition of the continent's past as well as for visualizing its possible trajectory. Because it stridently took the traditional historians of Africa and the prevailing neo-colonial order to task, it was also vociferously criticized by the defenders of the status quo. In these neoliberal times, its visibility has waned. Mainstream scholars and pundits from and outside of Africa proclaim that it is no longer a relevant work for Africa. In <em>The Enduring Relevance of Walter Rodney's How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</em>, Karim F Hirji makes a systematic case that, on the contrary, Rodney's seminal work retains its singular value for understanding where Africa has come from, where it is going, and charting a path towards genuine development for the people of Africa. Hirji considers Rodney in his unitary persona as a historian, theoretician and activist. He begins by outlining the publication history and contents of HEUA, and noting the comments it has drawn from varied quarters. This is followed by a depiction of the global context within which it saw the light of the day and the flowering of progressive thought and vision in those vibrant times. The retrogressive reversal, in thought and social reality, that has transpired since then is summed up next. An assessment of how HEUA has weathered this storm is also provided. The next chapter presents a brief portrait of Rodney as a revolutionary, with the focus on his seven years at the University of Dar es Salaam. This is followed by an overview of the methodological framework utilized in HEUA.</p> <p>These five chapters lay the foundation for the main substantive part of Hirji's book. This part begins with a detailed evaluation of the criticisms that have been levelled at HEUA. Subsequently, by a review of eight textbooks of general African history in common use today is provided. The aim here is to assess the persistence, if any, of ideas of the type promoted by Rodney in such books and identify the manner in which HEUA is directly depicted therein. Do these books give an adequate and fair depiction of Rodney to modern day students?</p> <p>The penultimate chapter argues for the continued relevance of Rodney and his seminal text for Africa (and the world) in this anti-people, pro-capital, pro-imperial neoliberal era. Hirji concludes with a lively account of his own interactions over six years with Walter Rodney. With the focus on the issue of building socialism in Tanzania, a key dimension in the evolution of Rodney's thinking is described in a critical spirit. The fundamental question addressed is, in our often dark, demoralizing political environment, what do Rodney and his life have to teach us on the matter of navigating between hope and struggle?</p> <p>The conclusion emerging from this book is that in the first place most of the criticisms of the content, style and practical value of HEUA lack merit. The representation of Rodney in mainstream books is as well replete with distortions, unfair selectivity and political bias.</p> <p>Hirji's succinct work is a consistent, coherent defence of an intellectual giant, an astute historian and a compassionate revolutionary who lived and died for humanity. It is an essential read for anyone with an interest in African history, and the fate of Africa and the regions that are historically related to it.</p></p><p>This book is an impassioned reintroduction for some, and an introduction for others, of work of the great 20th century Marxist and Pan Africanist, Walter Rodney. It demonstrates the continuing relevance of Rodney's insight, frame- work and many conclusions for the struggles facing the African World in the 21st century. - Bill Fletcher, Jr., former President of TransAfrica Forum, writer &amp; activist.</p><h2>Cornerstones for Professionalism</h2><p><p>The Second Edition is written specifically for college students who are preparing to go into the workforce.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <i>Cornerstones for Professionalism</i>&nbsp;prepares students for the workplace through a wide variety of techniques and strategies and shows them how to continue their upward mobility once on the job.

Through helpful chronological tables, an annotated guide to further reading and an exceptional range of visual images, they will enrich and extend the book&#39;s discussion.Conn presents a rather compact, encapsulated literary history that is very much historical in intent and achievement. From the first chapter, "The Colonial Experience," to the last, "Midcentury and Beyond," the arrangement of this history is chronological. Many of the illustrations are portraits or photographs of authors. Others, though, help to locate the literature in time and place. The book is not loaded with insights, but that is not its intent. Instead, it reads like an introduction and would probably make a very good supplement to a high school or undergraduate American literature survey.

Among the key figures who influenced this revolution were female physical educators. Drawing on extensive archival research, <em>Active Bodies</em> examines the ideas, experiences, and instructional programs of white and black female physical educators who taught in public schools and diverse colleges and universities, including coed and single-sex, public and private, and predominantly white and historically black institutions. Working primarily with female students, women physical educators had to consider what an active female could and should do in comparison to boys and men. Applying concepts of sex differences, they debated the implications of female anatomy, physiology, reproductive functions, and psychosocial traits for achieving gender parity in the gym. Teachers' interpretations were conditioned by the places where they worked, as well as developments in education, feminism, and the law, society's changing attitudes about gender, race, and sexuality, and scientific controversies over the nature and significance of sex differences. While deliberating fairness for their students, women physical educators also pursued equity for themselves, as their workplaces and nascent profession often marginalized female and minority personnel. Questions of difference and equity divided the field throughout the century; while some teachers favored moderate views and incremental change, others promoted justice for their students and themselves by exerting authority at their schools, critiquing traditional concepts of "difference," and devising innovative curricula. <br><br>Exploring physical education within and beyond the gym, <em>Active Bodies</em> sheds new light on the enduring complexities of difference and equity in American culture.<br></p><p><br><strong>Martha H.

Painting a brilliant and moving portrait of the world of female physical educators in a field that is still gendered, hierarchical, and insecure, she provides powerful arguments about the ways in which the profession, standing at the crossroads of science, culture, and daily life, has historically located-and continues to locate-sex differences directly in the body."--Patricia Vertinsky, University of British Columbia<p></p><br>"Verbrugge rescues women's gym class experiences from merely the loving wonder of singer Meg Christian's 'Ode to a Gym Teacher' or our worst memories of failure. <em>Active Bodies</em> is a tour de force history of the role of physical education in the naturalization of gender, sexuality, and racial differences and the struggle waged for equality and justice. Written with wit coupled to the research and narrative skills of a great historian, Verbrugge's work provides what will become a classic in women's educational and sports history."--Susan M. Reverby, Wellesley College<p></p><br>"Focusing on female physical education instructors in high schools and colleges over the course of the twentieth century, Martha Verbrugge has written a model study of the interaction of scientific, medical, and feminist theories of the female body as they are interpreted by educators directly involved in disciplining and liberating the adolescent female body. With a nuanced perspective, Verbrugge deals with difference as well as similarity, showing variations by region and institutions, black as well as white. A must read for historians of education and of sports, Verbrugge's sweeping perspective elucidates the history of women more generally, while showing the persistence of racism and homophobia even in eras of general advance."--Lois Banner, author of <em>Revelations: The Passion and Paradox of Marilyn Monroe</em><p></p><br>"Martha H.

No snickers, please, about gym class and gym teachers.

There are many entries on horror movies and the better-known horror writers (only writers who write no fantasy, such as Richard Laymon, are excluded). You'll also find carefully written definitions of horror, dark fantasy, supernatural fiction, gothic fiction, psychological thrillers, and weird fiction. <i>Locus</i> calls <i>The Encyclopedia of Fantasy</i> "massive and welcome," and writes, "This will be the standard reference for years to come."Winner of the Hugo and World Fantasy Awards!<p> "This will be the standard reference for years to come." --<i>Locus</i></p><p> "If you are in any way involved in the business of fantasy, or a serious collector, or a dedicated student, you really won't want to be without it....Very highly recommended." --<i>Realms of Fantasy</i></p><p> "An excellent and highly readable source for fantasy, the first of its kind." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p> "An extremely well done book that will appeal to a variety of users.

Teacher and performer Doug Goodkin presents an overview of the dynamic approach to music education known as Orff Schulwerk. In this comprehensive look at the many facets of this timeless practice, the author hopes to re-imagine its import in the lives of children, schools and culture at large in contemporary times.

The inmate, judge, probation officer, correctional officer, counselor, cleric, warden/superintendent, and others interact to form critical relationships that can either enhance or detract from the rehabilitative and correctional potential of incarcerated offenders, as well as those on probation and parole. This thought-provoking collection of case studies enables the reader to assume each of these roles, engages them in ethical analysis of real-life situations, and immerses them in the complex decision-making processes necessary to solve the problems encountered in today's correctional process.<p> Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Braswell et al., <i>Case Studies in Criminal Justice Ethics,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577667476); Haas-Alpert, <i>The Dilemmas of Corrections: Multidisciplinary Perspectives,</i> Fifth Edition (ISBN 9781577663980); Kratcoski, <i>Correctional Counseling and Treatment,</i> Fifth Edition (ISBN 9781577663461); Morash-Schram, <i>The Prison Experience: Special Issues of Women in Prison</i> (ISBN 9781577662020); and Quinn, <i>Corrections: A Concise Introduction,</i> Second Edition (ISBN 9781577662464).</p></p><p>Titles of related interest from Waveland Press: Haas-Alpert, The Dilemmas of Corrections: Contemporary Readings, Fourth Edition (ISBN 0881339822); Jones, Community Corrections (ISBN 157766261X); Kratcoski, Correctional Counseling and Treatment, Fifth Edition (ISBN 1577663462); Morash-Shram, The Prison Experience: Special Issues of Women in Prison (ISBN 1577662024); and Quinn, Corrections: A Concise Introduction, Second Edition (ISBN 1577662466).</p><h2>General and Oral Pathology for the Dental Hygienist</h2><p>This updated Third Edition of General and Oral Pathology for the Dental Hygienist provides the information students need to develop an understanding of basic pathology and recognize the clinical manifestations of oral and systemic disease.

Used in the early plays as a verbal or structural device, dream becomes, in the tragedies and late romances, a transforming experience which leads the dreamer toward a moment of self-awareness. In this illuminating study, now reissued with a new preface by the author, Marjorie Garber skillfully charts the development of Shakespeare's use of dream from the opening lines of <i>Richard III</i> to the magic of <i>A Midsummer Night&#x2019;s Dream</i> to <i>Hamlet</i>&#x2019;s most famous soliloquy. &nbsp; Drawing on the works of Freud and other psychologists, but basing its argument on the language and dramatic structure of the plays themselves, <i>Dream in Shakespeare</i> presents a coherent and innovative reading of the plays and their developing concept of dream. &nbsp;</p><p><b><b>Marjorie Garber</b>&nbsp;</b>is the William R.

This has now been abridged, but nevertheless the essence of the original is maintained. . . . Lombardo gives us a realistic Aeneas, whose frail humanity and thoughtful heroism are manifested subtly, in unpretentious, yet dignified language. . . . This would prove a worthy (and cheap!) addition to a bookshelf lacking the full translation by Lombardo. He manages to give a real sense of Virgil through a style that is elegant and solemn, yet never overbearing."<br> --Philip Harrison, <i>The Journal of Classics Teaching</i></p><br><br><p>"This attractive volume, an abridgment of Stanley Lombardo's complete translation of Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i> (Hackett, 2005), adds a Latin epic to the author's burgeoning set of translations of mainly Greek poetry. Lombardo has proved himself a poet-translator and performer of exceptional ability and innovation; by publishing in written and audio media, he has contributed to the awareness in the readership of translations the centrality of performance to Homeric epic. The recently published Aeneid represented his first foray into Latin epic, and he has translated Virgil with the same combination of austerity and accessibility that marked his Homers. . . .

"I traveled among many of the prairie Indians," Brown said, "and after meeting the old Sioux priest Black Elk, I was asked by him to record the account he should give me of his ancient religion.

For many Americans, he was the voice and face that gave shape and meaning to every day's news. But who was Peter Jennings really? In this absorbing biography, readers will get to know Jennings through the memories of his friends, family, competitors, colleagues, and interview subjects. Their stories are full of surprises. Jennings, we learn, was a high school dropout who spent the rest of his life in pursuit of knowledge. He traveled the world in search of stories, a notebook perpetually thrust through his back belt loop. In his front pocket, he carried a miniature copy of the Constitution, a testament to his love for the United States; a Canadian by birth, Jennings acquired American citizenship in 2003.<p>Peter Jennings was a celebrity, of course&#x2014;a dashingly handsome and elegant man, famous for his ability to charm women and world leaders alike&#x2014;but in these pages he is remembered as a loyal friend and a devoted family man, who loved nothing more than to canoe with his kids and listen to jazz with his friends in the Hamptons. Not that he was the relaxing sort. Jennings was a task-master, who ripped other reporters' pieces to shreds, forcing them to rewrite from the ground up. He was a perfectionist, too, who drove his fellow correspondents crazy with his ad-libbed questions on the air. It was all about standards. Throughout his life, Peter Jennings was driven by a passion to seek the truth and convey that truth accurately, simply, cleanly, and elegantly to his American audience. He was our voice.</p></p><p>The bulk of the interviews in this oral history&#x2014;co-edited by Sherr, his colleague at ABC News, freelance book editor Darnton, and Jennings's widow&#x2014;were conducted in the days immediately following the anchorman's death from lung cancer in August 2005. Friends and fellow reporters retrace every step of his career, starting with his first jobs in Canadian radio to his coverage of major events like the 9/11 attacks. When he was just 26, he was hired by ABC to anchor the evening news, a job he himself would later admit he was simply unqualified for at the time. So he demanded to be sent out into the field as a foreign correspondent, building up his experience until he became what Ted Koppel calls a complete package as a journalist: smart, attractive and graceful under pressure. The tone of the interviews is predictably positive: even the criticism that he allowed ABC's ratings to slip by refusing to devote more airtime to O.J. Simpson's murder trial is immediately followed by praise for his expanded coverage of the Bosnian genocide. Sections on his personal life along with testimonials from statesmen like Bill Clinton and Colin Powell flesh out the portrait, reminding readers of the commanding presence Jennings held over broadcast journalism. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here are the ideas of apologists, propagandists, and poets about the Crusades, as well as the perceptions and motives of the crusaders themselves and the means by which they joined the movement.<br> The authors describe the elaborate social and civic systems that arose to support the Crusades--taxation, for example, was formalized by the Church and monarchs to raise enormous funds needed to wage war on this scale. And here are vivid descriptions of the battles themselves, frightening, disorienting, and dangerous affairs, with keen and insightful commentary on the reactions of the Muslims to a Christian holy war. Extensively illustrated with hundreds of photographs, paintings, drawings, maps, chronologies, and a guide to further reading, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the</em> <em>Crusades</em> even includes coverage of crusades outside the eastern Mediterranean region and post-medieval crusades.<br> From descriptions of the battles and homefront conditions, to a thorough evaluation of the clash (and coalescence) of cultures, to the legacy of the crusading movement that continues into our conflict-torn twentieth-century, to the enduring artistic and social changes that the Crusades wrought, <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Crusades</em> offers an informative, engaging, and unsurpassed panorama of one of the great movements in western history.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> Jonathan Riley-Smith is Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the University of Cambridge and is one of the world's leading authorities on the Crusades. His previous publications include <em>The The Atlas of the Crusades</em> and <em>The Crusades: A Short History</em>.<br>In 1095 Pope Urban II granted absolutions to whomever would reclaim the Holy Land for Christendom. With that assurance began two centuries of Crusades, and the story, in contemporary chronicles, artwork, and castellated ruins, is well treated in this interpretation of the movement to take up the cross. The subject has stirred from historiographical dormancy, says editor Riley-Smith, who ably introduces the definitional questions--What is a Crusade? Who became a Crusader?--and then turns the chapters over to a dozen specialists. They analyze in detail the complex religious, economic, and military aspects, emphasizing the immediate instigation of one Crusade or another--often a Muslim counter-Crusade like Saladin's recapture of Jerusalem in 1187--while reiterating the profound piety and concern for salvation on which the whole process rested. It seems an odd combination of compassion and conquest, aptly expressed in knightly orders such as Hospitallers or the Teutonic Order, so elusive to the modern sensibility. These historians, though, dissolve that psychological barrier, interpreting what impelled the pilgrims, the Muslim reaction, and the political course of holy conflict up through the fall of the last Crusader polity--Malta--in 1798. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The United States and Western Europe since 1945: From &#34;Empire&#34; by Invitation to Transatlantic Drift</h2><p>Based on new and existing research by a world-class scholar, this is the first book in 20 years to examine the dynamics of the American-European relationship since 1945.

However, many of these people have little interest in the religious aspects of Buddhism, and the practice occurs within secular contexts such as hospitals, schools, and the workplace. Is it possible to recover from the Buddhist teachings a vision of human flourishing that is secular rather than religious without compromising the integrity of the tradition? Is there an ethical framework that can underpin and contextualize these practices in a rapidly changing world?<br> &nbsp;<br> In this collected volume of Stephen Batchelor&#x2019;s writings on these themes, the author explores the complex implications of Buddhism&#x2019;s secularization. Ranging widely&#x2014;from reincarnation, religious belief, and agnosticism to the role of the arts in Buddhist practice&#x2014;he offers a detailed picture of contemporary Buddhism and its attempt to find a voice in the modern world.</p><p><b>Stephen Batchelor</b> is a teacher and scholar of Buddhism. He trained as a monk for ten years in traditional Buddhist communities and now presents a secular approach to Buddhist practice. The author of the bestselling <i>Buddhism without Beliefs</i>, he lives near Bordeaux, France."Batchelor&#x2019;s work will undoubtedly appeal to many 'spiritual, but not religious' readers."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>&#x201c;A thoughtful, conversational, and accessible volume.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br>&#x201c;This wide-ranging anthology will appeal to anyone interested in exploring Buddhism within a framework that is both conversant with and challenging to a Western intellectual heritage.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> (a Best Book of 2017 choice, Religion &amp; Spirituality category)<br>"What Batchelor calls 'secular Buddhism' or 'Buddhism 2.0' is a delicate balancing act. . . . Batchelor&#x2019;s reimagination is Janus-faced, simultaneously looking backward and forward. On the one hand, if it loses sight of the past, it risks losing the capacity of 'Buddhism' to challenge and transform contemporary culture . . . On the other hand, if it does not look forward, the Dharma becomes confused with the cultural and metaphysical beliefs and strategies of long-gone ages. . . . This Janus-faced stance is a new manifestation of the Buddhist Middle Way, negotiating what remains powerful, even revolutionary, in the tradition, while creatively transforming it to resonate not only in new cultural soil, but also to be able to respond to contemporary exigencies."&#x2014;Jason M. Wirth, <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br> &nbsp;<br>"Brilliant, illuminating, and thought-provoking,&nbsp;<i>After Buddhism</i>&nbsp;deserves the ultimate compliment for a work of this kind: it is useful. In probing the ancient scriptures in search of a Buddha we can relate to, Batchelor makes his dharma come thrillingly alive. A masterful achievement."&#x2014;Mark Epstein, author of&nbsp;<i>Thoughts without a Thinker</i><br>"In this remarkable book, Stephen Batchelor transcends Buddhist dogma to surface a vision of the dharma that goes right to the heart of our contemporary global culture. Through diligent scholarship and years of practice, the author sheds new and revelatory light on the dharma. This is a must-read for all students of Buddhism."&#x2014;Joan Halifax, Abbot, Upaya Zen Center<br>"With exemplary lucidity, Stephen Batchelor demonstrates the relevance of an ancient thought and practice in our own era. There is much in it that illuminates and clarifies&#x2014;for those acquainted with Buddhism as well as those coming to it for the first time."&#x2014;Pankaj Mishra<br>"Drawing on insights gleaned during decades of intensive practice, study, and writing, Batchelor&#x2019;s essays demonstrate conclusively how the ancient texts of Buddhism speak directly to the needs of contemporary people living active, engaged lives in the world."&#x2014;Robert E. Buswell, Jr., University of California, Los Angeles<br>"An audacious disquisition on Buddhism, universal dharma, reality, and suffering for the 21st century. Batchelor posits that for the deep wisdom of Buddhism to serve humanity fully in our time, it may have to transcend itself."&#x2014;Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of&nbsp;<i>Full Catastrophe Living&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Coming to Our Senses</i><br></p><h2>Not Monsters: Analyzing the Stories of Child Molesters</h2><p>What could possibly motivate a person to molest a child? In search of insights, Not Monsters documents the stories of nine convicted child molesters through oneonone interviews, listening to what offenders have to say about their crimes and exploring the roots of these behaviors from a social constructionist perspective. Their words paint a compelling and frightening portrait of how sexual abuse works in Western culture to perpetuate a political and social system of dominance and control.</p><p><b>Pamela D. Schultz</b> is associate professor of communication studies at Alfred University, New York.<i>Not Monsters</i> is a valuable book that is both well written and highly informative. Pamela Schultz has done an excellent job in providing straightforward information about the impact of sexual abuse on victims as well as on men who sexually abuse children, looking critically at the motivation behind their behavior. Working in the field for almost three decades has taught me that punishment alone will not prevent sexual abuse from occurring. We need to fully and completely understand it. <i>Not Monsters</i> provides a daring look into child sexual abuse and furthers our understanding of this public health problem, lending support to the national efforts to prevent child sexual abuse. (Robert E. Longo, independent consultant and trainer, Sexual Abuse Prevention &amp; Education Resources International)<br><br>A courageous book that involves a look into the mirror of the author's own experience as a victim of sexual abuse to answer the question: 'Why?' This research provides some of the more revealing accounts of child sexual offending and the life histories of offenders to date&#x2015;a narrative study that brings us a step closer to deciphering the reasons men violate unspeakable sexual boundaries. Professionals addressing the issues of perpetrators and victims should read this book. (Douglas W. Pryor, author of Unspeakable Acts: Why Men Sexually Abuse Children)<br><br>This work provides an important contribution to the academic literature because it provides the reader with firsthand accounts from convicted child molesters. Although this may be a rather dark subject matter for many scholars, it nevertheless proves for fascinating reading; and it is, in fact, very well written.

A survivor of childhood sexual abuse intent on breaking the silence surrounding the issue, Schultz peers into theminds of molesters who were willing to reveal their lives, experiences, and perspectives on their molestations, disclosure, arrest, understanding of the crime, and future plans. These narratives describe the perpetrators' childhoods and the onset of molesting behavior. Interpretations of their actions reflect the Groth Typology (established categories of sexual offenders&#x2015;e.g., fixated, regressed, sex-pressured). Looking at the personal, situational, organizational, and cultural/historical aspects of thenarratives, Schultz asks perpetrators how they think society can combat this crime. She argues that widespread ritual abuse is a myth: most molesters know their victims but are not murderers, and convicted perpetrators have a lower overall recidivism ratethan those convicted of other crimes. She believes that molesters are not beyond redemption, but she points out the lack of available research on treatment and the fact that Megan's Law and notification policies are cumbersome and untested.

Daniel Q. Gillion refers to this theory as &#39;discursive governance&#39;. Federal politicians&#39; statements about racial and ethnic minority concerns aid the passage of minority public policies and improve individual lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, most of the American public continues to disapprove of politicians&#39; rhetoric that highlights race. The book argues that addressing racial and ethnic inequality continues to be a tug-of-war between avoiding the backlash of the majority in this nation while advocating for minority interests. Even though this paradox looms over politicians&#39; discussions of race, race-conscious political speech, viewed in its entirety, is the mechanism by which marginalized groups find a place in the democratic process. Such race-conscious discussions, the book argues, have ramifications both within and outside of government.</p><p>Governing with Words challenges the perception that politicians&#39; discussion of race only hinders policy success and leads to a backlash from the American public. This study will be assigned to undergraduate and graduate students taking courses on race and ethnic politics, public policy, political communication, and health policy.Daniel Q.

Se�n McConville examines the years from the formation of the Northern Ireland state to the release of the last border campaign prisoners in 1962. </p> <p></p> <p>Drawing extensively and, in many cases, uniquely on archives and special collections in the three jurisdictions, and interviews with survivors from the period, McConville demonstrates how punishment came to embody and shape the nationalist consciousness. <i>Irish Political Prisoners 1920-1962</i> commences with the legacy of the Anglo Irish and Irish Civil Wars - militancy, division and bitterness. The book travels from the embedding of Northern Ireland&#x2019;s security agenda in the 1920&#x2019;s, and the IRA&#x2019;s search for a role in the 1930&#x2019;s (including the 1939 bombing campaign against Britain) to the decisive use of internment during the war and the border campaign years. This volume will be an essential resource for students of Irish history and is a major contribution to the study of imprisonment. </p> <p>. </p></p><p><p>Se�n McConville is Professor of Law and Public Policy at Queen Mary, University of London. He has researched and taught at leading universities on both sides of the Atlantic. His interests and publications range widely, from Islamic criminal law to prison architecture, but have clustered around the philosophy and administration of punishment &#x2013; historically, comparatively and in current debates. He is the author of the first in this trilogy <i>Irish Political Prisoners 1848-1922</i> (Routledge, 2005).</p><p>"<em>Irish Political Prisoners, 1920&#x2013;1962 </em>is a meticulously researched book that marks the partial culmination of an ambitious scholarly endeavour. It is...an unsurpassed account of how the struggle for Irish freedom was shaped by the carceral experiences of its protagonists. This is a fascinating book written with style, verve and scrupulous attention to detail. It will be read with profit by those who take an interest in politics, history, penal policy, or criminal justice."-<em>Ian O&#x2019;Donnell, University College Dublin </em></p> <p>"...it is important in our understanding of Irish and Anglo-Irish history that we have such a reliable guide to show us the role played by Irish political imprisonment, a guide who is prepared to unveil so wisely what happened in these arguable quieter years of Irish political development." <em>Richard English, University of St. Andrews</em></p></p><h2>The Complete Ford Flathead V8 Engine Manual</h2><p>This is the most thorough book on the subject of Fords famous flatmotor.

In this book we are concerned with the construction of the former. Our intent is to provide the reader with a firm theoretical basis for compiler construction and sound engineering principles for selecting alternate methods, imple� menting them, and integrating them into a reliable, economically viable product. The emphasis is upon a clean decomposition employing modules that can be re-used for many compilers, separation of concerns to facilitate team programming, and flexibility to accommodate hardware and system constraints. A reader should be able to understand the questions he must ask when designing a compiler for language X on machine Y, what tradeoffs are possible, and what performance might be obtained. He should not feel that any part of the design rests on whim; each decision must be based upon specific, identifiable characteristics of the source and target languages or upon design goals of the compiler. The vast majority of computer professionals will never write a compiler. Nevertheless, study of compiler technology provides important benefits for almost everyone in the field . � It focuses attention on the basic relationships between languages and machines. Understanding of these relationships eases the inevitable tran� sitions to new hardware and programming languages and improves a person&#39;s ability to make appropriate tradeoft&#39;s in design and implementa� tion .</p><p></p><h2>Approaches to Teaching Garc�a M�rquez&#39;s One Hundred Years of Solitude (Approaches to Teaching World Literature)</h2><p>Now at seventy-three volumes, this popular MLA series (ISSN 1059-1133) addresses a broad range of literary texts.

Here, the internationally acclaimed photography curator brings together over 300 color and duotone images that explore human intimacy in all its forms&#x2014;from the innocent sensuality of a mother and child, to the group adoration of a cultural icon, to the carnal connection between the sexes. These images&#x2014;both the famous and the obscure from the past 150 years of photography&#x2014;come together in a thought-provoking exploration of humankind&#x2019;s deepest yearnings. Sliding easily into its translucent slipcase, this beautifully designed book offers an amazing array of compelling images at an irresistible price.</p><p>The sister book to <i>The Body</i>, which was also written and edited by William Ewing, <i>Love and Desire</i> collects a diverse range of images that attest to Ewing's belief that "all photographs are, at some level, about love, and all photographs are triggered, to varying degrees, by desire." In pursuing this theme, Ewing classifies the photographs into eight different categories--Bonds, Icons, Observation, Propositions, Tokens, Libidos, Reveries, and Obsessions. Each of these chapters begins with an essay in which Ewing draws on his deep knowledge of the history of photography to explain the relevance of the selected images. The photos themselves run a full gamut of historical imagery, from the beginning days of the medium up through contemporary art and recent commercial photography. Julia Margaret Cameron explores a family bond in her depiction of the Madonna and child, dated 1865. In 1955, Frank Horvat, in all likelihood standing on a Paris bridge, observes a couple kissing on the quay below. Helmut Newton explores obsession in the mid-1980s with his portrait of a stockinged ankle and foot in a black stiletto heel. Brassa�'s 1932 portrait of Janet--in which Janet is depicted from the waist up, lying back on a bed, her eyes closed, with a look of ecstasy on her face--opens the Libidos chapter. There are hundreds of other compelling images here, and together they go far to define the complex nature of human love and desire. <i>--Mary Wren</i>William A. Ewing is a wellknown writer on the art of photography and an independent curator whose exhibitions have been shown at the Museum of Modern Art and the International Center of Photography in New York, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and many other museums and galleries.

This fourth edition is a revised and updated version of this bestselling introductory textbook. It retains the clear and concise style of the previous editions of the book and focuses on examples from biological and environmental sciences. The major update with this edition is that R code has been included for each of the analyses described, although in practice any standard statistical package can be used.</p> <p>The original idea with this book still applies. This was to make it as short as possible and enable readers to begin using multivariate methods in an intelligent manner. With updated information on multivariate analyses, new references, and R code included, this book continues to provide a timely introduction to useful tools for multivariate statistical analysis.</p></p><p><p>"... <i>Multivariate Statistical Methods: A Primer </i>has a fairly standard coverage of available multivariate statistical methods, but stands out in its presentation of these, which is concise, pedagogic, and easy to follow. Each chapter is fairly short, covering only the most essential details, using mathematical formulas only when it is necessary. The stated purpose of the book, to introduce multivariate statistical methods to non-mathematicians while keeping details to a minimum, but still conveying a good idea of what can be done in the area of multivariate statistics, is thus well fulfilled.<br>The book takes a practical approach to multivariate statistical methods, with illustrations utilizing real, varying data sets from different disciplines, thus making it useful for the applied statistician. ... To summarize, this is a very nice book giving a concise not overly technical treatment of multivariate statistical methods that is highly recommended for anyone wanting to have an easy-to-understand overview of this important subject."<br>&#x2015;Andreas Rosenblad, Uppsala University, in <i>Journal of Statistical Software</i>, June 2017</p> <p>"This book is a great choice for an undergraduate or graduate level multivariate statistics course where the students have some previous exposure to statistical methods but don&#x2019;t need the mathematical foundations of the methods themselves. The authors provide interesting examples with explanations and interpretations without an overuse of mathematical notation, which makes this book accessible to a wide audience. The inclusion of an appendix at the end of each section on using R to conduct multivariate analyses is a useful addition to the book. The strengths of this book are the advice provided from an experienced practitioner and that it provides an introduction to a wide variety of multivariate methods. I used the first edition of this book as a graduate student and the third edition for an undergraduate course I recently taught. It continues to improve with each edition."<br>&#x2015;<b>Debra L.

Like its previous editions, this new, fourth edition of MSM strives to help the reader develop an intuitive understanding of multivariate data while providing examples and a gentle introduction to its basic mathematical concepts. Readers should take heart to appreciate this approach. It is important that all users, from social scientists to analytics professionals, have a basic conceptual understanding of multivariate methods so that they are able to properly vet, interpret, and use their data analyses. In addition to an overview of each method, MSM provides several useful and interesting multivariate data sets, which it uses throughout the text as examples, and this fourth edition also provides the R code for these examples as an appendix to each chapter.

The ICMC was organized in reaction to the Putnam Exam - its problems were to be more representative of the undergraduate curriculum, and students could work on them in teams. Participation was originally restricted to the small, private colleges and universities of the state, but was later opened up to students from all of the schools in Indiana. The competition was quickly nicknamed the &#34;&#34;Friendly&#34;&#34; Competition because of its focus on solving mathematical problems, which brought faculty and students together, rather than on the competitive nature of winning. Organized by year, the problems and solutions in this volume present an excellent archive of information about what has been expected of an undergraduate mathematics major over the past 35 years. With more than 245 problems and solutions, the book is also a must buy for faculty and students interested in problem-solving. The index of problems lists problems in: Algebraic Structures; Analytic Geometry, Arclength, Binomial Coefficients, Derangements, Differentiation, Differential Equations, Diophantine Equations, Enumeration, Field and Ring Theory, Fibonacci Sequences, Finite Sums, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Geometry, Group Theory, Inequalities, Infinite Series, Integration, Limit Evaluation, Logic, Matrix Algebra, Maxima and Minima Problems, Multivariable Calculus, Number Theory, Permutations, Probability, Polar Coordinates, Polynomials, Real Valued Functions Riemann Sums, Sequences, Systems of Equations, Statistics, Synthetic Geometry, Taylor Series, Trigonometry, and Volumes.</p><p>Rixk Fillman received his PhD from Idaho State University.

He contends that the greatest threat to social and cultural development is the destruction of young people's ability to pay critical attention to the world around them. This phenomenon, prevalent throughout the first world, is the calculated result of technical industries and their need to capture the attention of the young, making them into a target audience and reversing the relationship between adults and children. <i>Taking Care</i> exposes the carelessness of these industries and urges the reader to re-enter the "battle for intelligence" against the drive-oriented culture of short-term ("short-circuited") attention characteristic of the negative aspects of the new technologies. Long-term attention, Stiegler shows, produces retentions of cultural memory mandatory for social development&#x2015;and for the counteracting of ADD and ADHD. Examining the history of education from Plato to the current quagmires in France and the United States, he tracks the notion of critical thinking from its Enlightenment apotheosis to its current eradication. Stiegler is unique in combining the most radical of theoretical constructs&#x2015;such as "grammatization"&#x2015;with quite traditional values, values he proposes we re-address in our not-so-brave new world.</p><p>Bernard Stiegler heads the Department of Cultural Development at the Pompidou Center in Paris and is co-founder of the political group <i>Ars Industrialis</i>. Stanford University Press recently published his <i>Technics and Time, 2: Disorientation</i> (2008), and <i>Acting Out</i> (2008)."Stiegler puts forward a compelling account of our dire situation in the West at the beginning of the twenty-first century and uncompromisingly insists on the need to embrace the difficult task of reclaiming the ideals of the critical Humanities while refusing to fall in the trap of demonizing technology." (<i>Year's Work in Critical and Cultural Theory</i>)<br><br>"A hugely prolific writer, for more than fifteen years philosopher Bernard Stiegler has been seeking both to articulate existence itself, and to ameliorate its contemporary woes. In what is a vast undertaking, Stiegler moves from the originary emergence of humanity to the safeguarding of its future by way of multi-volume analyses that range widely between and across technology, political economy, art, palaeontology, television, democracy and industrial and hyperindustrial societies. Focusing on education and the changing role of the school in contemporary Western societies, <i>Taking Care of Youth and the Generations</i> continues this project, while at the same time going some way to explain the sense of urgency which characterizes much of Stiegler's previous writing."

Virtually all children are competent contextual learners as demonstrated, not only by the learning of stories, but by the early mastery of their native language as well. AT the core of the methodology is the awareness that mathematics is best retained by reconstruction rather than memorization. Consequently, it defines the antithesis of rote, and was created to eliminate rote learning from mathematics education forever.</p><p></p><h2>Introductory Chemistry</h2><p>Open Tro to See The Difference from other Intro/Prep Chemistry books.

Illustrated with over 150 color and black-and-white pictures, chosen to illuminate and complement the text, this lively and readable work is an ideal introduction to philosophy for anyone interested in the history of ideas. From Plato's <em>Republic</em> and St. Augustine's <em>Confessions</em> through Marx's <em>Capital</em> and Sartre's <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, the extraordinary philosophical dialogue between great Western minds has flourished unabated through the ages. Dazzling in its genius and breadth, the long line of European and American intellectual discourse tells a remarkable story--a quest for truth and wisdom that continues to shape our most basic ideas about human nature and the world around us. That quest is brilliantly brought to life in <em>The Oxford History of Western Philosophy</em>.<br> With spectacular illustrations--including sixteen pages of full-color plates--this splendidly written volume takes the reader on a magnificient chronological tour through the revolutions of thought that have forged the Western philosophical tradition from ancient times to the present. Throughout, the six contributors--an internationally renowned team of philosophers including Roger Scruton, Anthony Quinton, and Anthony Kenny--bring the astonishingly diverse, wide-ranging landscape of intellectual history into sharp focus, emphasizing how notions seen today as part of an inevitable march of ideas were in their own time often considered radical, if not revolutionary. Thus we are treated, for example, to lively accounts of how Plato's "theory of forms" and Aristotle's pioneering exercises in logic broke with the past to irrevocably alter the course of Western thought. The authors also reveal the relationships between landmark thinkers, and the ways they drew on their intellectual heritage. They show, for instance, how St. Augustine and Aquinas, though advancing the cause of Christian doctrine, picked up where their pagan Greek forebears had left off. We witness how, during the Renaissance, the profound empiricist ideas underlying Descarte's famous utterance--"I think, therefore I exist"--lived in a tense but complementary relationship with Locke's rationalist theories. Moving into the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the book explores how Hume greatly influenced Kant's conception of the "transcendental aesthetic," and how Hegel drew upon the lesser known (but groundbreaking) work of Fichte and Schelling. The authors bring the story up to our own time, vividly recounting the existential trend from Nietzsche ("God is dead") to Sartre, along with other increasingly fractious schools of thought. Along the way, we not only encounter the vast intellectual riches of the Western mind, but we also meet the personalities behind the great thoughts, from the saintly Hume (described by Adam Smith as having "come as near to perfection as anybody could") to the ill-mannered outcast Fichte. And the hundreds of maps and striking illustrations (including full-color reproductions of art ranging from medieval manuscripts to the works of Raphael, Ingres, and Magritte) form an integral part of the book, revealing the interweaving of art and ideas through the ages, as artists have striven to give visual immediacy to philosophical concepts.<br> <em>The Oxford History of Western Philosophy</em> is the most authoritative single-volume account ever written for the general reader. Engagingly written and astonishingly far-reaching, it provides the consummate introduction to the intellectual bedrock upon which Western civilization is built.</p><p>What does philosophy look like? Can you take a picture of it? <i>The Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy</i> may not answer these questions, but it manages to ask them artfully with just a hint of schizophrenia. Sometimes it is a concise but substantive account of the history of Western philosophy; other times it is a coffee-table book that lends itself to casual thumbing-through. Pause long enough to wonder at Kant's silhouette, Jeremy Bentham's infamous Panopticon, a photo of Machiavelli's writing desk, or the Ephesian wall painting of Socrates. The volume lives up to its name: there are over two dozen full-color pictures--such as Paul Gauguin's arresting painting <i>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</i>--and myriad black-and-white illustrations of all varieties. <p> Editor Anthony Kenny parses his history into just six chunks of philosophy--ancient, medieval, three flavors of modern, and political--but amazingly the book does not seem to skimp on details. The reader will find everything from a treatise on Pseudo-Dionysius to an explanation of Kant's Paralogisms of Pure Reason to an analysis of Wittgenstein's private language argument. The six contributors to this book are philosophical heavyweights, and their accounts are inevitably colored by their respective likes and dislikes. But in sum <i>The Oxford History of Western Philosophy</i> is first-rate scholarship that succeeds where almost all academic histories fail: it's fun! <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Sir Anthony Kenny</strong>, president of the British Academy and Warden of Rhodes House, Oxford University, is the author of numerous works including <em>What is Faity?</em>, <em>The Metaphysics of Mind</em>, and <em>Aristotle on the Perfect Life</em>.<br></p><h2>Construction Productivity: On-Site Measurement and Management</h2><p>*** Please Read This *** Like new - Ships from Ohio - No Markings - Fast Shipping- Free tracking - 13-A-1</p><p></p><h2>Look Homeward Angel</h2><p>The first novel by the great American novelist now the subject of a major new film Genius starring Jude Law Colin Firth Dominic West and Nicole Kidman Eugene Gant born in 1900 to harddrinking stonecutter Oliver and entrepreneurial Eliza grows up in smalltown America Both lonely outsider and passionate chronicler of American life Eugene experiences upheaval and family tragedy before coming to realise that he must leave his home behind if he is to forge his own path in the world This is the dazzlingly rich first novel from one of the most brilliant and mercurial voices of early twentiethcentury who was a major influence on writers including Hunter S Thompson Ray Bradbury Philip Roth and the Beats This new edition includes an introduction by Elizabeth Kostova author of The Historian Wolfes second novel Of Time and the River continuing the story of Eugene Gant is also now available in Penguin Classics</p><p>Thomas Wolfe (Author) Thomas Wolfe was born in North Carolina in 1900.

T. Barnum, in particular--and draws a dark vision of a country being swallowed by its illusions of progress.Why is Dalkey Archive doing yet another edition of The Confidence-Man? And why is it doing Melville at all? First, this edition, originally published by Bobbs-Merrill over forty years ago, contains remarkable annotations by H. Bruce Franklin, intended for both the general reader and the scholar. It's an edition we have long admired. More importantly, we believe that The Confidence-Man is America's first postmodern novel--game-like, darkly comic, and completely inventive.</p></p><p>Long considered the author's strangest novel, <i>The Confidence-Man </i>is a comic allegory aimed at the optimism and materialism of mid-eighteenth-century America. A mysterious shape-changing Confidence-Man approaches passengers on a Mississippi steamboat and, winning over the (not quite innocent) victims with his charm, urges them to implicitly trust in the cosmos, in nature, and even in human nature-with predictable results.<br><br><i>The Confidence-Man</i> represented a departure for Melville, a satirical and socially acute work that was to be a further step away from his sea novels. Yet it confused and angered reviewers who preferred to pigeonhole him as an adventure writer. Some have argued the book was a joke on the readers loyal to his sea stories, but if so, it backfired. Dismissed by critics as unreadable, and an undoubted financial failure, <i>The Confidence-Man</i>'s cold reception undermined Melville's belief in his ability to make a living writing works that were both popular and profound, and he soon gave up fiction. It was not until the mid-twentieth century that critics rediscovered the book and praised its wit, stunningly modern technique, and wry view that life may be just a cosmic con game.&#34;In &#34;The Confidence-Man,&#34; writes John Bryant in his Introduction, &#34;Melville found a way to render our tragic sense of self and society through the comic strategies of the confidence game. He puts the reader in the game to play its parts and to contemplate the inconsistencies of its knaves and fools.&#34; Set on a Mississippi steamer on April Fool&#39;s Day and populated by a series of shape-shifting con men, &#34;The Confidence-Man is a challenging metaphysical and ethical exploration of antebellum American society. Set from the first American edition of 1857, this Modern Library paperback includes an Appendix with Bryant&#39;s innovative &#34;fluid text&#34; analysis of early manuscript fragments from Melville&#39;s novel.</p><h2>Our Blessed Mother (St. Joseph Board Books)</h2><p><p>Ideal book for young children.

Their unique stories reveal African Americans fighting for an alternative economic and civil rights movement&#x2015;even as the Republican Party appeared increasingly hostile to that very idea. Black party members attempted to influence the direction of conservatism&#x2015;not to destroy it, but rather to expand the ideology to include black needs and interests.</p><p>As racial minorities in their political party and as political minorities within their community, black Republicans occupied an irreconcilable position&#x2015;they were shunned by African American communities and subordinated by the GOP. In response, black Republicans vocally, and at times viciously, critiqued members of their race and party, in an effort to shape the attitudes and public images of black citizens and the GOP. And yet, there was also a measure of irony to black Republicans' "loneliness": at various points, factions of the Republican Party, such as the Nixon administration, instituted some of the policies and programs offered by black party members. What's more, black Republican initiatives, such as the fair housing legislation of senator Edward Brooke, sometimes garnered support from outside the Republican Party, especially among the black press, Democratic officials, and constituents of all races. Moving beyond traditional liberalism and conservatism, black Republicans sought to address African American racial experiences in a distinctly Republican way.</p><p><i>The Loneliness of the Black Republican</i> provides a new understanding of the interaction between African Americans and the Republican Party, and the seemingly incongruous intersection of civil rights and American conservatism.</p></p><p><p>"African American Republicans!

Drawing on materials from popular culture, avoiding the standard stylistic indications of poetic lyricism, and using nonsequential sentences are some of the ways in which language writers make poetry a more open and participatory process for the readers. Reading this kind of writing, however, may not come easily in a culture where poetry is treated as property of a special class. It is this barrier that Bob Perelman seeks to break down in this fascinating and comprehensive account of the language writing movement. A leading language writer himself, Perelman offers insights into the history of the movement and discusses the political and theoretical implications of the writing. He provides detailed readings of work by Lyn Hejinian, Ron Silliman, and Charles Bernstein, among many others, and compares it to a wide range of other contemporary and modern American poetry.</p><br><p> A variety of issues are addressed in the following chapters: "The Marginalization of Poetry," "Language Writing and Literary History," "Here and Now on Paper," "Parataxis and Narrative: The New Sentence in Theory and Practice," "Write the Power," "Building a More Powerful Vocabulary: Bruce Andrews and the World (Trade Center)," "This Page Is My Page, This Page Is Your Page: Gender and Mapping," "An Alphabet of Literary Criticism," and "A False Account of Talking with Frank O'Hara and Roland Barthes in Philadelphia."</p></p><p><p>"Bob Perelman, both as a poet and an extremely intelligent and witty analyst of the language writing movement, writes as someone genuinely hoping to explain his subject to readers who are not already converts."<b>--Roger Gilbert</b></p><b>Bob Perelman,</b> Associate Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, is a nationally known poet.

Does the proliferation of depictions of suffering in the media enhance, or endanger, compassion? How do we live and die well in the extended periods of debility which old age now threatens? Why and how should we grieve for the dead? And how should we properly remember other grief and grievances?<br><br>In addressing such questions, the Christian imagination of human life has been powerfully shaped by the imagination of Christ's life. Christ's conception, birth, suffering, death, and burial have been subjects of profound attention in Christian thought, just as they are moments of special interest and concern in each and every human life. However, they are also sites of contention and controversy, where what it is to be human is discovered, constructed, and contested. Conception, birth, suffering, burial, and death are occasions, in other words, for profound and continuing questioning regarding the meaning of human life, as controversies to do with IVF, abortion, euthanasia, and the use of bodies and body parts post mortem, indicate.<br><br>In <em>The Ethics of Everyday Life</em>, Michael Banner argues that moral theology must reconceive its nature and tasks if it is not only to articulate its own account of human being, but also to enter into constructive contention with other accounts--in particular, it must be willing to learn from and engage with social anthropology if it is to offer powerful and plausible portrayals of the moral life and answers to the questions which trouble modernity. Drawing in wide-ranging fashion from social anthropology and from Christian thought and practice from many periods, and influenced especially by his engagement in public policy matters including as a member of the UK's Human Tissue Authority, Banner develops the outlines of an everyday ethics, stretching from before the cradle to after the grave.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Banner</strong> is Dean and Fellow at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.

Research and application over the past twenty years have moved the idea from explaining the past failures of team policing, to a method that could avoid these past pitfalls, to a viable but crude method in the 1980s, to the successful and detailed practices of the 1990s, to the institutionalization of community-oriented policing by the turn-of-the-century. There is little doubt that this paradigm in policing has captured the attention of both citizen and police, mayors and police chiefs, state government and national government officials, and has worked its way into becoming a household name. In fact, it has become so popular that one of America's leading econometricians, Anthony Downs, has called for more federal funding of community-oriented policing and placed it on his list of several actions to address his highest priority, reducing personal insecurity (Downs, Anthony. New Visions for Metropolitan America. Washington D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1994). The dilemma of understanding then arises in how community-oriented policing is defined and what the paradigm entails. It is to this end that we must now set our sights. </p><p> Perhaps one of the first debates over this approach lies in questioning if it is "old wine in a new bottle." Critics of this paradigm have thus argued it is early-twentieth-century policing glorified and that turning back the policing clock would prove detrimental to both the profession and the citizens served. These critics seem to miss the fact that it is more than just making a new case for the methods, practices, and procedures utilized by the police today, but, rather, it is argument for changing the way we think about policing, from the perspectives of both the police and the community. Abraham Lincoln perhaps said it best: "As our case is new, so we must think and act anew." We recognize that the current case for promulgating community-oriented policing is new; what we on many occasions have failed to do, from both an academic and practical standpoint, is allow ourselves to think and act anew. Although nostalgia, common in all organizations, may exist in policing, community-oriented policing is not a push backward but rather a rapid movement forward regarding the mission of the police and how they perform their duties. Yet, despite this realization, the questions continue to linger as to what specifically constitutes community-oriented policing. </p><p> A key debate within the central understanding of the systemic approach to policing is whether community-oriented policing is a philosophy or a program. The argument on the side of a philosophy is rooted in the premise that for the systemic approach to be fully functional it must grow from a conceptual framework from which all the actors can adhere to mutual principles but retain the freedom to ad-lib. The argument on the programmatic side is rooted in the understanding that methods employed by the actors must be more substantive and should therefore be put forth in a script with written parts for each actor. The argument can be further broken down into whether community-oriented policing is a concept for the way we think about the police or for actions garnering the policing. It is an argument between the theoretical and the practical. </p><p> To delineate between the importance of the two, it is important to reach an age-old method of issue resolution: compromise. Theory, often in its true form, ignores the practical application, thus negating the possible benefits derived from a theory. Practical application, in turn, often ignores theory, thus negating the benefits that can be derived from a guiding theoretical construct. The consensus lies in the commitment for both the theoretical and practical to coalesce into a synthesis that supersedes the ontological perspectives, thus creating a mutually beneficial relationship. The synthesis can then be utilized for the proposition of a conceptual framework, from which to guide the systemic application from the theoretical to the practical. </p><p> Community-oriented policing, as a systemic approach to policing, is in fact the realization of this synthesis. It incorporates both tie theoretical and the practical into the overall framework, thus allowing for the maximization of benefits. It must start as a new philosophy, a new way of thinking about the role of the police in society, and it must be enacted through new and various programs that adhere to the philosophical premise. This, then, is the primary emphasis of this book. It is an attempt to weave together both the theoretical and the practical, as well as combine the various interpretations of the systemic approach, into one concept under the banner of community-oriented policing. OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK'S CONTENTS </p><p> New to the second edition of the textbook are two chapters (Chapters 13 and 14) detailing the comparative approach to community-oriented policing and the federal (U.S.) role under the systemic approach. In addition, the latest research on community-oriented policing, which has continued to expand exponentially, has been added to the main text where appropriate. Finally, new charts, photographs, and boxes providing specific examples of community-oriented policing have been included to provide a more contemporary understanding of the systemic approach to policing. </p><p> The first chapter is a historical review of police and community relations since the formation of the United States. Although other authors have attempted to analyze the eras of policing from a strict police perspective, in this chapter I analyze the relationship between the two parties and place them into eras indicative of the type of relationship occurring at the time. A review of history from this perspective, it is largely historical, and that is acceptable, because it allows the reader a better understanding of the different relationships we are now entering into under the auspices of community-oriented policing. </p><p> Chapter 2 is the guiding chapter for the rest of the book in that it attempts to provide a clear understanding of what community-oriented policing is and how it is defined, in both theoretical and practical terms. The construct of the chapter shares a three-pronged process that was assembled to reach a definition of community-oriented policing. It reflects the multitude of definitions and explanations that have surfaced in the academic literature for the past twenty years, which covers both theoretical constructs and research methodologies. It reflects the practical applications covered in various journals and magazines and synthesizes the definitions and actions implemented by police departments across the United States under the auspices of community-oriented policing. And, finally, the third prong is the inclusion of my understanding and definition of the systemic approach based on my experiences as a police officer and the community-oriented policing programs I have had the fortune to witness. The culmination of this three-pronged approach has revealed many consistent themes throughout the academic literature, the practical literature, and my own experiences. Community-oriented policing can then be defined as </p><p> a systemic approach to policing with the paradigm of instilling and fostering a sense<br> of community, within a geographical neighborhood, to improve the quality of life. It<br> achieves this through the decentralization of the police and the implementation of a<br> synthesis of three key components: (1) strategic-oriented policing&#x2014;the redistribution<br> of traditional police resources; (2) neighborhood-oriented policing&#x2014;the .interaction of<br> police and all community members to reduce crime and the fear of crime through<br> indigenous proactive programs; and (3) problem-oriented policing-a concerted effort<br> to resolve the causes of crime rather than the symptoms.</p><p></p><p> The next four chapters concentrate on expanding the definition, by breaking down each component into its own chapter, along with one additional chapter that explains how the three become synthesized into one framework: community-oriented policing. Chapter 3 is a more detailed explanation of strategic-oriented policing and all of the potential methods the police can employ to successfully adopt this component. Chapter 4 is an overview of the many types of police and community programs that can promote interaction and communication between the two actors to understand the quality-of-life benefits that can be derived from this cooperation. Chapter 5 defines the component of problem-oriented policing and draws heavily from the works of Herman Goldstein (academic) and John E. Eck and William Spelman (practical). Chapter 6 is an overview of how the three components are integrated into the systemic approach of community-oriented policing. Chapter 6 also includes three case studies of a large-, medium-, and small-sized police department and demonstrates how they have implemented the three components as they relate to the systemic approach. </p><p> Chapter 7 provides an understanding of how the systemic approach to policing will mandate systemic changes to both the organization of the police department and the management methods employed. It specifically details how the police department must decentralize by geography, personnel, and structure to achieve the true benefits of community-oriented policing, and it reviews the varying types of management practices that complement the systemic approach, specifically total quality management (TQM). </p><p> The next three chapters detail the role of the three key actors involved in ensuring the success of community-oriented policing: the police, the community, and the police chief. Chapter 8, on the role of the police, gives wide coverage to the changes that must be made to transform traditional police officers to community-oriented police officers. Because the police are the street-level implementors of the philosophy and programs under the systemic approach, they are a key link to the overall success of community-oriented policing. However, because the systemic approach is geared toward the community, it is readily apparent that the community's role in community-oriented policing is equally important. Its role is detailed in Chapter 9, which provides an understanding of what is meant by community and how past attitudes of not getting involved in police matters can be overcome. Chapter 10 then provides the key link to the relationship between the police and the community: the role of the police chief in community-oriented policing. This role, as a result of changes in the police, community, and organizational and management structures, must also change to accommodate the synthesis of philosophy and practical applications. It is important that the chief become a dynamic member of the community and that the chief's office provide the impetus for the systemic approach. </p><p> Chapter 11 sketches a rough outline for implementing the systemic approach to policing. Community-oriented policing is a profound change to police practices of the past; therefore, it is not a "program" that can be implemented overnight but one that must see a gradual and incremental form of implementation to ensure its success. Each department will see variations on its community-oriented policing methods as a result of endogenous variables, exogenous variables, and the differences that account for both space (location of the police department) and time (the current development of the police department); each department will then see a different time line for implementation of the systemic approach. </p><p> Chapter 12 proves to be the most daunting of the chapters, but it highlights the fact that evaluations under community-oriented policing are crucial to the success of this paradigm. The evaluation process must not be limited to one actor but made a part of the everyday duties of the police and can include surveys of local citizens, police officers, and local government employees. As the systemic approach is implemented in an incremental fashion, these surveys become part of the evaluation process and provide the necessary information for the police, citizens, and police chief to make the determination as to whether a particular program or policing method should be continued, deleted, or altered in some way. </p><p> Chapter 13 details the comparative approach to community-oriented policing by first raising the awareness of comparative studies and then articulating the comparative approach as it applies to the systemic approach to policing. The community-oriented policing programs of Canada, Britain, and Japan are explored in depth, followed by a brief review of other community-oriented policing endeavors worldwide. </p><p> Chapter 14 explores the ever-expanding federal role in community-oriented policing as a result of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which created the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) under the U.S. Department of Justice. The chapter reviews the politics behind the "100,000 cops" initiative, how it included the concepts of community-oriented policing, and the methods by which the federal government chose to become involved in the systemic approach. It specifically details the various grants for personnel and equipment, describes the training initiatives, and provides a critical assessment of the COPS program to date. </p><p> Chapter 15 covers many of the caveats that go with implementing community-oriented policing. These caveats are based on the various failures of past policing experiments and recent failures with community-oriented policing. This information provides an insight into why certain programs have failed in the hopes that these methods will not be repeated in future implementations of the systemic approach. Hence, these are not in actuality problems for the implementation process but rather caveats to make the police department that decides to shift to this new paradigm aware of the many possibilities for failure. </p><p> Finally Chapter 16 speaks of the future benefits that police departments may receive when implementing community-oriented policing, as well as the overall benefits that have already been achieved. It also delves further into the future to discuss many of the potential benefits and provides some discussion for how police departments can plan for the future, today.</p><b> <p>4th Edition</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Community-Oriented Policing:&nbsp; A Systemic Approach to Policing</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Building on the strength of previous editions:</p> </b> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth edition of Oliver&#x2019;s community-oriented policing textbook presents an expanded and slightly reformatted textbook in order to clearly present the current state of community-oriented policing in America and across the globe.&nbsp; The results of over 50 peer-review studies in community-oriented policing are included in the latest edition, as well as the numerous writings on community-oriented policing over the previous three years.&nbsp; The book has been reformatted by eliminating the synthesis chapter from the previous editions in order to bring the expanded book back into a more acceptable format and size of 15 chapters without losing the comprehensive scope as seen in previous editions.&nbsp; In addition, current material related to the discussion of community-oriented policing in an era of Homeland Security is addressed, as well as the recent federal budget cuts to community-oriented policing programs.&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also New to the Fourth Edition:</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *New photos from police department community-oriented policing programs across the United States</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Updated box material presenting examples of community-oriented policing in action</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *The latest research and debate on the systemic approach to policing</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I think Oliver does an excellent job of organizing the book around specific topics or subjects &#x2014; and then covers each in an appropriate manner.&nbsp; The chapter flow and the level of rigor are both consistent and appropriate.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;The material in the text is current . . . and the author is positive about community-oriented policing, which is understandable, [but] I think the author is also aware of the real issues about community-oriented policing and the possibility that some things might not work.&nbsp; I would definitely use the text by Oliver&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;The content of the text is excellent.&nbsp; The completeness and diligence of the research, and the compilation and interpretation of the information discovered, is obvious.&nbsp; The utilization of tables, figures, photographs, etc., is well done and appropriate for a text of this type.&nbsp; In my opinion Professor Oliver has done an outstanding job in combining this collective wisdom into a readable text.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> <p> <i>&nbsp;</i> </p> <b> <p>Willard M.

Here John Ikenberry asks the question, what do states that win wars do with their newfound power and how do they use it to build order? In examining the postwar settlements in modern history, he argues that powerful countries do seek to build stable and cooperative relations, but the type of order that emerges hinges on their ability to make commitments and restrain power.</p><br><p> The author explains that only with the spread of democracy in the twentieth century and the innovative use of international institutions--both linked to the emergence of the United States as a world power--has order been created that goes beyond balance of power politics to exhibit "constitutional" characteristics. The open character of the American polity and a web of multilateral institutions allow the United States to exercise strategic restraint and establish stable relations among the industrial democracies despite rapid shifts and extreme disparities in power.</p><br><p> Blending comparative politics with international relations, and history with theory, <i>After Victory</i> will be of interest to anyone concerned with the organization of world order, the role of institutions in world politics, and the lessons of past postwar settlements for today. It also speaks to today's debate over the ability of the United States to lead in an era of unipolar power.</p></p><p><p>"For the third time in this troubled century and following the end of the Cold War and the tragic events in the former Yugoslavia, the world is challenged to create a stable and enduring world order. In this pathbreaking book, Ikenberry draws upon novel theoretical insights and historical experience to determine what policies and strategies work best as the United States attempts to lead in the struggles to create a new world order. . A major contribution to IR theory and to thinking about international order."<b>--Robert Gilpin, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Through careful, thorough, and subtle analysis of the diplomacy of the post-war settlements of 1815, 1919, 1945, and 1989--91, John Ikenberry addresses in <i>After Victory</i> three major questions for the study of world politics: how do major-state victors seek to translate their military success into a sustainable political order; why do secondary-state partners accept the order so constructed by the major victors; and why have post-war settlements become progressively based on institutional principles and practices? In its theoretical boldness, historical sweep, policy relevance, and sheer elegance of analysis and presentation, few books published in the past quarter-century in the field of international relations are the equal of <i>After Victory</i>."<b>--Joseph Grieco, Duke University</b></p><p>"<i>After Victory</i> is an extremely important inquiry into the origins of postwar order in international relations--the key analytic and policy issue of our time. Ikenberry's book is unique in its theoretical and empirical sweep. In contrast to realists, for whom international orders are epiphenomenal and transient, and constructivists, who see order emerging from shared worldviews and norms, Ikenberry adopts a historical sociological framework. He argues that states self-consciously create institutions to bind themselves and others in international orders that reduce the 'returns to power'."<b>--David A. Lake, University of California, San Diego</b></p><p>"<i>After Victory</i> argues that political primacy is achieved best through a strategy of limiting the unilateral exercise of power. This book engages contemporary political debates, and it illuminates these debates with an informative set of historical case studies.

So important is Greece to history that figures such as Plato and Socrates are still household names, and the works of Homer are regularly adapted into movies. The most acclaimed hero of all, though, is Alexander the Great.While historians have studied Alexander&#x2019;s achievements at length, author and professor Richard A. Billows delves deeper into the obscure periods of Alexander&#x2019;s life before and after his reign. In the definitive Before and After Alexander, Billows explores the years preceding Alexander, who, Billows argues, without the foundation laid by his father, Philip II of Macedon. would not have had the resources or influence to develop one of the greatest empires in history. Alexander was groomed from a young age to succeed his father, and by the time Philip was assassinated in 336 BC, his great empire was already well underway.The years following Alexander's death were even more momentous. In this ambitious new work, Richard Billows robustly challenges the notion that the political strife that followed was for lack of a leader as competent as Alexander, pointing out instead that there were too many extremely capable leaders who exploited the power vacuum created by Alexander's death to carve out kingdoms for themselves.Above all, in Before and After Alexander, Billows eloquently and convincingly posits a complex view of one of the greatest empires in history, framing it not as the achievement of one man, but the culmination of several generations of aggressive expansion toward a unified purpose.</p><p><b>Richard A. Billows </b>is a professor at Columbia University specializing in Ancient Greek and Roman epigraphy. He is the author of <i>Marathon: How One Battle Changed Western Civilization</i>, as well as <i>Antigonos the One-Eyed and the Creation of the Hellenistic State</i>, <i>Kings and Colonists: Aspects of Macedonian Imperialism</i>, and <i>Julius Caesar: The Colossus of Rome</i>. He lives in New York City.&#x201c;A thorough analysis of the legacy of history&#x2019;s most famous conqueror. According to Billows, Alexander the Great was more of an accident of history than a maker of it . . .&nbsp;The author meticulously defends his provocative thesis about Alexander&#x2019;s role with in-depth historical analysis and an array of citations and quotes from primary sources, making this a clear, enlightening exploration of one of the most influential periods of human history.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An absorbing revisionist history of the ancient world.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[An] elegant and jarring take on overly romanticized Alexander.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Winnipeg Free Press</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Much has been written on the life and conquests of Alexander the Great, but Richard Billows has given us something new&#x2015;a solidi and eminently readable look at the Macedonian world that gave birth to Alexander and the legacy that followed him.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Philip Freeman, author of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar</strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Before and After Alexander</em> is a welcome addition to the vast array of works on this famous Macedonian king. Billows invites his readers to assess the significance of Alexander by situating his conquests within a broader historical narrative about Macedonian state formation . . .

Yet for most of his 20 years in the Senate, Ervin was Jim Crow&#39;s most talented legal defender as the South&#39;s constitutional expert during the congressional debates on civil rights. The paradox of the senator&#39;s opposition to civil rights and defense of civil liberties lies at the heart of this biography of Sam Ervin. Karl Campbell illuminates the character of the man and the historical forces that shaped him. The senator&#39;s distrust of centralized power, Campbell argues, helps explain his ironic reputation as a foe of civil rights and a champion of civil liberties.</p><p>"This is a masterful political biography. Karl E. Campbell's beautifully written biography of Senator Sam Ervin is a first-rate achievement. Campbell persuasively shows how Ervin's experiences in North Carolina shaped his Senate career as an opponent of civil rights <i>as well as</i> a supporter of civil liberties."--Merle Black, co-author of <i>Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics</i> <br>Karl E.

Why do we differ in our personalities? How do these differences matter in life? This textbook on<strong>Individual Differences and Personality</strong> aims to describe how and why personality varies between one person and the next. Unlike books that focus on individual theorists, this book focuses on current research and theory on the nature of personality and related individual differences. The book begins by discussing how personality is measured, the concept of a personality trait, and the basic dimensions of personality. This leads to a discussion of the origins of personality, with descriptions of its developmental course, its biological causes, its genetic and environmental influences, and its evolutionary function. The concept of a personality disorder is then described, followed by a discussion of the influence of personality on life outcomes in relationships, work, and health. Finally, the book examines in detail the important differences between individuals in the realms of mental abilities, of beliefs and attitudes, and of sexuality.<br><br>Intended for courses in personality and individual differences, this book may also serve as a useful overview of personality research for academics in related fields. Singly authored for consistency of breadth, depth, and presentation,<strong>Individual Differences and Personality</strong> will engage students with its interesting boxed asides. Sample boxes describe a wide variety of topics, including such issues as cross-generational differences, personality in animals, personality and occupational choice, the role of the womb environment, and many others. In addition to covering the Big Five and HEXACO models of personality structure, the book also includes topics often left out of other personality books, including individual differences in mental abilities, religion, politics, and sexuality. There is also deep coverage of the biological bases of personality, including discussions of neurotransmitters, brain structures, and hormones. The explanation of genetic and environmental influences is made clear and straightforward, and the discussion of evolutionary function is unique among personality texts.<br><br>Table of Contents: Introduction; Basic Concepts in Psychological Measurement; Personality Traits and the Inventories That Measure Them; Personality Structure: Classifying Traits; Developmental Change and Stability of Personality; Biological Bases of Personality; Genetic and Environmental Influences on Personality; The Evolutionary Function of Personality; Personality Disorders; Personality and Life Outcomes; Mental Ability; Religion and Politics; Sexuality; Conclusion.Michael C.

Only the customary red wax affixed to the objects indicated that their origin was in fact Nepal. Art lovers - fascinated by the masks' expressions and the thickness of patina - enthusiastically began to collect them, though they were still shrouded in mystery. In this beautifully photographed book, Bertrand Goy and Max Itzikovitz set out to uncover the history of the masks and to determine their place in Nepalese culture.<br><br>The authors also investigate western Nepal's unsophisticated, anthropomorphic wood sculptures, which can be seen today in temples, on bridges, and on the outskirts of villages. No one knows if these are protective effigies or tributes to divinities from an antiquated religion. With an insightful text and striking imagery, this book attempts to pull back the veil on one of the world's most cryptic art forms.</p><p>Bertrand Goy, a member of the Soci�t� de G�ographie and the Soci�t� des Africanistes, is a specialist in the history of primitive arts.

They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered <strong><em>career relevance</em></strong> as their guide when selecting material, and the need to <strong><em>engage the student</em></strong> as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design. <p><strong>Libby/Libby/Short</strong> successfully implements a real-world, single <strong>focus company approach in every chapter</strong>. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting.</p> <p><strong>Libby/Libby/Short</strong> believes in the <strong>building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis</strong>. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries.</p></p><p>Patricia Libby is Chair of the Department of Accounting and Associate Professor of Accounting at Ithaca College, where she teaches the undergraduate financial accounting course.

Surpassing the scope of any previously published single-volume work, this atlas pairs expert scholarship with bold mapping to vividly depict the ebb and flow of destruction and reconstruction.<br><br>Divided chronologically into five sections, the <em>Atlas of the Civil War</em> illustrates every significant battle and military campaign while simultaneously considering the important social themes that shaped the country during the same time period. All theaters of war in which armies fought and maneuvered will be covered in detail and, marking a major departure from other atlases, this volume will devote substantial attention to the nonmilitary elements of the struggle between North and South. Maps of population, economic development, elections, transportation networks and patterns of enlistment illuminate the intersections between the home front and the battlefield, demonstrating with specially commissioned cartography that no war is fought in isolation from the rest of society. Approximately forty three-dimensional maps of terrain and troop movements add yet another unique element to this ambitious reference.<br><br>Written by two esteemed Civil War historians, Kenneth Winkle and Steven Woodworth, the pithy text is accented with black and white photography and illustrations that bring key characters and settings to life. Pulitzer-prize winning author James McPherson, guides the project, setting the tone of the atlas with a foreword and five shorter essays the open each of the sections.</p><p><br><strong>Steven Woodworth</strong> is Professor of History at Texas Christian University. <strong>Kenneth Winkle</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Nebraska.<br>This is the latest in a long series of atlases dealing with the American Civil War.<p>Each of five major chapters is devoted to a single year from 1861 to 1865. In addition to every important battle, there is coverage of nonmilitary topics, such as population, the economy, transportation, elections, and the home front. For example, the chapter "1862: The Struggle for Union" has a section on the Emancipation Proclamation (with a table showing the number of slaves per county in 1862). The chapter "1863: The Turning of the Tide" has a section on Confederate trade. Each chapter covers around 60 pages. The work ends with a list of major battle sites, a chronology, a glossary, a short bibliography, and an index, which provides access to illustrations and maps as well as names.</p><p>The most stunning feature of this atlas is the full-color maps that depict not just battles but the value of farmland, the spread of slavery, the construction of railroads, and more. Approximately 40 specially commissioned three-dimensional maps show terrain and troop movements. The western campaigns, such as the invasion of New Mexico by Texas, receive full coverage even though they are not as widely known as the more famous battles in the East. Even smaller battles, such as Pleasant Hill and Mansfield, which are important to Louisiana but not well known outside the state, are included. Illustrations, many of them reproductions of period photographs, add still another dimension to this work.</p><p>What sets this atlas apart from others on the Civil War is the inclusion of the social, cultural, economic, and political facets of the war. Its scope and reasonable price recommend it to high-school, public, school, and academic libraries. <i>Abbie Vestal Landry</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Marc Matera shows the significant contributions of people of African descent to London&#x2019;s rich social and cultural history, masterfully weaving together the stories of many famous historical figures and presenting their quests for personal, professional, and political recognition against the backdrop of a declining British Empire. A groundbreaking work of intellectual history, <i>Black London </i>will appeal to scholars and students in a variety of areas, including postcolonial history, the history of the African diaspora, urban studies, cultural studies, British studies, world history, black studies, and feminist studies.</p><p>&#x201c;Marc Matera offers us a vibrant and sophisticated history of the people of African descent, both famous and fugitive, who coursed through the heart of the British Empire in their quest for personal, professional, and political recognition in the twentieth century. Part social history, part collective biography, this genealogy of peripatetic black political formation reveals London as a bustling global portal for some of the most inspiring people who championed anticolonial modernity. <i>Black London</i> archives the often terrible, troubling contradictions at the heart of racialized and sexualized imperial encounters and asks us to rethink both the makers and the tempos of decolonization.&#x201d;&#x2014;Antoinette Burton, author of <i>Empire in Question: Reading, Writing, and Teaching British Imperialism</i><br><br> &#x201c;Marc Matera&#x2019;s vibrant and kaleidoscopic excavation of black London traverses a stunning range of domains (from political activism to newspaper editing, from jazz performance to sexuality) to explore in admirable detail the complexities of what it meant to be black in the English metropole in the interwar period. If the book is a nuanced study of the emergence of black internationalism at the height of empire, it is also a marvel of rediscovery, bringing back to light a number of overlooked or understudied figures, including Una Marson, Amy Ashwood Garvey, Coleridge Goode, and Ras Prince Monolulu. Simply put, <i>Black London</i> is a must-read.&#x201d;&#x2014;Brent Hayes Edwards, author of <i>The Practice of Diaspora: Literature, Translation, and the Rise of Black Internationalism</i><br><br> &#x201c;This engaging and lively book, richly peopled and powerfully situated in time and space, brings the multiple worlds of black Londoners vividly to life. <i>Black London</i> charts a web of black intellectuals, performers, and ordinary citizens who saw London as the place in which they might remake themselves, along with transforming the core of imperial thought and policy. Marc Matera&#x2019;s account of the diverse sights and sounds&#x2014;along with politics and personal relationships&#x2014;of the late imperial metropole explains much about the complex dynamics of race and urbanity not only in the twentieth century but in the twenty-first as well.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jordanna Bailkin, author of <i>The Afterlife of Empire</i><br><br> &#x201c;Marc Matera&#x2019;s carefully historical and deeply researched study places figures and events familiar in pan-African history in a richly textured setting. Reaching far beyond political protests against imperialism and racism, Matera traces the lives of women and men moving from Soho music clubs to Speakers&#x2019; Corner, from film sets to university seminars, through interracial sexual liaisons and diverse alliances with British activists. He reveals how, despite much disagreement and difference, black London gathered people and influences from Africa and its diaspora and generated both powerful alternate views of the future and cultural forms which later found new homes around the Atlantic world. Many stories within black Atlantic history will be enriched by this book.&#x201d;&#x2014;Philip S. Zachernuk, author of <i>Colonial Subjects: An African Intelligentsia and Atlantic Ideas</i><br><br> &#x201c;Marc Matera offers a fine, comprehensive reconstruction of black London, demonstrating conclusively the degree to which the imperial metropole worked to generate the counterforces of a vibrant black internationalism. He tells a powerful story that provides an essential dimension to our understanding of decolonization.&#x201d;&#x2014;Bill Schwarz, author of <i>Memories of Empire, Volume I: The White Man&#x2019;s World</i><br><br> &#x201c;In this deeply researched, compelling story about the daily lives, desires, and political activism of African and Caribbean intellectuals in interwar London, Marc Matera offers a fine-grained analysis of the institutional spaces and polyvalent cultural practices that both gave rise to a unique African diasporic formation and fostered a set of black internationalist sensibilities that would resonate throughout the twentieth century. With careful attention to organizational networks, social relationships, and the intimacies that made up black life in the imperial metropolis, Matera places black feminists and less well-known figures alongside a more familiar cast of black male actors to show how their efforts at elaborating an alternative political imaginary involved pursuing a world whose horizon lay beyond the British Empire.&#x201d;&#x2014;Minkah Makalani, author of <i>In the Cause of Freedom: Radical Black Internationalism from Harlem to London, 1917-1939</i><br><br> "Marc Matera's story is full of human drama, brave choices, people doing the unfashionable and unfathomable, agitating for self-government and cultural respect, and making a thoroughly un-British spectacle of themselves."&#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement<br><br> "</i><i>Black London</i>&nbsp;is gratifying both for its careful attention to detail and its nuanced analysis of the political and social lives of the black intellectuals who lived in this mid-twentieth-century world. The view of the black society Matera provides is as important for revealing the differences and contradictions among its participants as it is for outlining their similarities and the unity they forged. Placing these men and women in the context of their everyday lives puts all the messy contradictions and complexities of reality on full display. And the resulting portrait is glorious."&#x2014;<i>H-Empire</i><b>Marc Matera</b> is Assistant Professor of History at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the coauthor of&nbsp;<i>The Women's War of 1929: Gender and Violence in Colonial Nigeria</i>.</p><h2>Constitutional Law For Dummies</h2><p><b>Discover the ins and outs of Constitutional law</b> <p>Are you a student looking for trusted, plain-English guidance on the ins and outs of Constitutional law?

As Downing's partner, and after Downing's death in 1852, Vaux designed country and suburban dwellings that were remarkable for their well-conceived plans and their sensitive rapport with nature.<br> By 1857, the year he published his book <em>Villas and Cottages</em>, Vaux had moved to New York City. There he asked Frederick Law Olmsted to join him in preparing a design for Central Park. He spent the next 38 years defending and refining their vision of Central Park as a work of art. After the Civil War, he and Olmsted led the nascent American park movement with their designs for parks and parkways in Brooklyn, Buffalo, and many other American cities.<br> Apart from undertakings with Olmsted, Vaux cultivated a distinguished architectural practice. Among his clients were the artist Frederic Church, whose dream house, Olana, he helped create; and the reform politician Samuel Tilden, whose residence on New York's Gramercy Park remains one of the country's outstanding Victorian buildings. A pioneering advocate for apartment houses in American cities, Vaux designed buildings that mirrored the advance of urbanization in America, including early model housing for the poor. He planned the original portions of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History and conceived a stunning proposal for a vast iron and glass building to house the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Especially notable are the many bridges and other charming structures that he designed for Central Park. Vaux considered the Park's Terrace, decorated by J. W. Mould, as his greatest achievement.<br> An active participant in the cultural and intellectual life of New York, Vaux was an idealist who regarded himself as an artist and a professional. And while much has been written on Olmsted, comparatively little has been published about Vaux. The first in-depth account of Vaux's career, <em>Country,</em> <em>Park, and City</em> should be of great interest to historians of art, architecture, and urbanism, as well as preservationists and other readers interested in New York City's past and America's first parks.<br></p><p>Ask the average New Yorker who designed Central Park, and those who know their history will probably say Frederick Law Olmstead--and they would be partially correct. But ask for the other half of the designing duo and watch for the blank stares. Notoriously introverted, Calvert Vaux left a legacy that, along with Central Park, includes Prospect Park in Brooklyn, original portions of both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, as well as many other New York landmarks, yet most people outside of the architectural field have never heard of him. In <i>Country, Park, &amp; City: The Architecture and Life of Calvert Vaux</i>, Francis R. Kowsky succeeds in rescuing Vaux from obscurity. In setting the record straight, Kowsky describes how Vaux originally approached Olmstead to join him in entering the design competition for Central Park in 1857, and after they won, the more charismatic Olmstead was recognized as the force behind the plan, while Vaux kept to the shadows. Kowsky also reveals Vaux as the originator of apartment-style urban dwellings, a concept that he applied to both upscale and low-rent complexes in New York, and which are now standard metropolitan domiciles. This richly detailed and often esoteric biography is a celebration of an artist who deserves recognition. Kowsky has colorfully put a face to the fa�ade.Francis R. Kowsky is at State University of New York at Buffalo.</p><h2>Patho Phlash!: Pathophysiology Flash Cards</h2><p><ul><br> <li><strong>Color-coded, body-system organization</strong>.</li><br> <li><strong>Supplemental categories</strong> on <strong>dermatologic conditions, mental health</strong>, and <strong>women&#x2019;s health.</strong></li><br> <li><strong>Card front</strong>&#x2014;the <strong>name of the condition</strong> � <strong>pronunciation </strong>� a <strong>clue </strong>to its meaning or significance � and the <strong>icon </strong>representing the associated <strong>body system</strong>. </li><br> <li><strong>Card back</strong>&#x2014;description of the pathophysiology � assessment and diagnostic findings � complications � and the medical and surgical treatments. </li><br> <li><strong>Memory aids</strong> on every card, including <strong>&#x201c;Keep in Mind, &#x201c;Make the Connection,&#x201d;</strong> and <strong>&#x201c;Remember.&#x201d;</strong></li><br> <li><strong>Charts, tables, </strong>and <strong>photographs </strong>throughout.</li><br> <li><strong>Comprehensive, alphabetical index</strong>.</li><br></ul></p><p>Ian Wood is Professor of Early Medieval History at the University of Leeds.</p><h2>God, Are You There?</h2><p><p>Popular teacher and speaker Kay Arthur has developed a study specifically for those who are unfamiliar with the Bible.&nbsp; It introduces readers not only to God's Word but to the God of the Word.</p><p>In this exciting study, Kay Arthur takes readers by the hand, gently leading them through the Gospel of John and introducing the inductive method of study.&nbsp; Readers will come away with solid, tested Bible study methods <i>and</i> an understanding of who God is and how to know Him better.</p><p><i>God, Are You There?</i> is a life-changing adventure into a beloved gospel.&nbsp; It's easy to use&#x2014;a "quick-start" program for anyone new to the truths of God's Word or for a group needing just the right number of lessons.</p></p><p><p><b>Kay Arthur</b> is a four-time Gold Medallion award-winning author, member of NRB Hall of Fame, and beloved international Bible teacher.

How did she prepare for her illustrious career during her years of obscurity, and what was her inspiration for the healing practices and doctrine of Christian Science? Gillian Gill, a non-Christian Science Scientist scholar, who managed to win unparalleled access to the Church archives, offers here an entirely new look at Mary Baker Eddy.For the first time readers will see the extraordinary leadership skills exercised by Mrs. Eddy despite the repressive forces facing women in her time. For the first time we learn the full story of the bizarre attack on Mrs. Eddy by Joseph Pulitzer and his <i>New York World</i> &#x2014;alleging that she was at least senile and possibly not even alive. In this enthralling biography, we rediscover Mary Baker Eddy as a radical Christian thinker, pioneer in the recognition of mind/body connections, survivor of scandal, and target of both admiration and scorn from such eminent contemporaries as Mark Twain. Gillian Gill's sense of drama, her critical acumen, and her delicious wit bring to life a brilliant religious leader whose message has new meaning in our time.</p><p>The feminist perspective of historian Gillian Gill (author of a previous biography of Agatha Christie) adds three-dimensionality to the life story of the controversial, charismatic founder of Christian Science. Neither unblemished saint nor unscrupulous manipulator, Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910) emerges in this substantive reassessment as a powerful woman so constrained by conventional notions of femininity that she suffered decades of frustration and ill health before liberating herself with radical new ideas. Her emphasis on spiritual healing and women's empowerment made enemies virtually from the first publication of <i>Science and Health</i> in 1875; the schisms and lawsuits that plagued her church gave Eddy's opponents ammunition. In her thorough coverage of such touchy matters, Gill doesn't deny her subject's imperiousness and tendency to paranoia, but her sympathetic analysis stresses Eddy's gifts as a religious leader, administrator, and propagandist. The author gained access to the closely guarded Christian Science archives without ceding editorial control, and her scrupulous effort to freshly judge every issue justifies this trust. Gill's dry wit and first-person presence in the text's opinions ensure that her lengthy, exhaustively documented narrative doesn't feel unduly daunting or academic. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Geology in the Nineteenth Century: Changing View of a Changing World (Cornell History of Science Series)</h2><p><p>Mott T. Greene traces the history of geology in nineteenth-century Europe and America in a clear and comprehensive introduction to the geological thought of the period. Greene asserts that the standard accounts of nineteenth-century geology, which dwell on the work of Anglo-American scientists, have obscured the important contributions of continental geologists; he balances this traditional emphasis with a close study of the innovations of the French, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Swiss geologists whose comprehensive theory of earth history actually dominated geological thought of the time. Based largely on original sources, Greene's account demonstrates that scientific interest in the late nineteenth century shifted from uniform and steady processes to periodic and cyclic events. He also puts continental drift theory in its context, showing that it was not a revolutionary idea but one that emerged naturally from the European geologists' study of the origin of mountains, oceans, and continents.</p></p><p><p>Mott T.

Samuel Fleischacker suggests that Smith's vastly influential treatise on economics can be better understood if placed in the light of his epistemology, philosophy of science, and moral theory. He lays out the relevance of these aspects of Smith's thought to specific themes in the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>, arguing, among other things, that Smith regards social science as an extension of common sense rather than as a discipline to be approached mathematically, that he has moral as well as pragmatic reasons for approving of capitalism, and that he has an unusually strong belief in human equality that leads him to anticipate, if not quite endorse, the modern doctrine of distributive justice.</p><br><p> Fleischacker also places Smith's views in relation to the work of his contemporaries, especially his teacher Francis Hutcheson and friend David Hume, and draws out consequences of Smith's thought for present-day political and philosophical debates. The <i>Companion</i> is divided into five general sections, which can be read independently of one another. It contains an index that points to commentary on specific passages in <i>Wealth of Nations</i>. Written in an approachable style befitting Smith's own clear yet finely honed rhetoric, it is intended for professional philosophers and political economists as well as those coming to Smith for the first time.</p></p><p><p>"On Adam Smith's <i>Wealth of Nations</i> reflects its author's long and reflective engagement with Smith's thought. There is much in the book that readers of Smith will find useful and indeed indispensable. Many of Smith's perspectives are reformulated with exemplary clarity; key puzzles in his oeuvre are puzzled out more successfully than by past commentators; and many a scholarly misinterpretation is set aright. Moreover, Fleischacker's emphasis on Smith's egalitarianism will prove controversial, and should stimulate discussion about what Smith meant in his own day and what he might mean to us."<b>--Jerry Z. Muller, Catholic University of America</b></p><p>"Until now, nobody has published a truly philosophical, let alone comprehensive and philosophical, commentary on Smith's great work of political economy.

And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

Richard Rorty, a Princeton professor who had contributed to the analytic tradition in philosophy, was now attempting to shrug off all the central problems with which it had long been preoccupied. After publication, the Press was barely able to keep up with demand, and the book has since gone on to become one of its all-time best-sellers in philosophy.</p><br> <p> Rorty argued that, beginning in the seventeenth century, philosophers developed an unhealthy obsession with the notion of representation. They compared the mind to a mirror that reflects reality. In their view, knowledge is concerned with the accuracy of these reflections, and the strategy employed to obtain this knowledge--that of inspecting, repairing, and polishing the mirror--belongs to philosophy. Rorty's book was a powerful critique of this imagery and the tradition of thought that it spawned. He argued that the questions about truth posed by Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and modern epistemologists and philosophers of language simply couldn't be answered and were, in any case, irrelevant to serious social and cultural inquiry. This stance provoked a barrage of criticism, but whatever the strengths of Rorty's specific claims, the book had a therapeutic effect on philosophy. It reenergized pragmatism as an intellectual force, steered philosophy back to its roots in the humanities, and helped to make alternatives to analytic philosophy a serious choice for young graduate students. Twenty-five years later, the book remains a must-read for anyone seriously concerned about the nature of philosophical inquiry and what philosophers can and cannot do to help us understand and improve the world.</p><br></p><p>"This is an ambitious and important book.

Now they share their colorful commentary and edgy common sense on every aspect of life, from food and eating (""Does Talking to Pop Tarts Mean You're Crazy?"") to fashion and grooming (""The Devil Wore Palazzo Pants"") to cleaning and organizing (""Not a Hoarder, Still a Slob""). You'll see it's okay not to measure up to perfectionistic standards of behavior and achievement at home, at work, and in relationships. Once you level with yourself and lighten up, life can be happier&#x2014;and a hell of a lot more fun.</p><ul><li>Tackles essential life issues&#x2014;including sex and dating, weight loss and body issues, marriage and relationships, cooking and kitchenphobia, and more</li><li>Shares Alexis and Jennifer's outrageously funny and honest stories and surprisingly helpful advice</li><li>Reveals Alexis and Jennifer's deepest, darkest personality quirks</li><li>Shows the importance of self-acceptance, complete honesty, and a wicked sense of humor</li></ul><p>So what if you're not perfect&#x2014;whatever! Get the real-deal advice of Alexis and Jennifer in <i>Whateverland.</i> It's definitely <i>not</i> your mother's self-help book.</p></p><p><br> <br> <strong> From the Authors: Directions to Whateverland</strong> <br><br> 1. Depart: Shame. Leave it behind and never go back. <br><br> 2. Flip through the front of the book and read the alternate definition of "whatever." Make sure when you read it that you pronounce the word this way: "What-EVVV-er." <br><br> 3. Flip through the book and look at spectacular photos of young Alexis and Jennifer as they grew up. Be sure not to miss the photo of Alexis running naked in a field as a toddler (p. 122) and Jennifer's giant prom hair and dress (p. 213). Then go back to the beginning of the book. <br><br> 4. Read through Introduction and make sure you're clear about the fact that this is a funny un-self-help self-help book that's going to help you more than an actual self-help book because it's not going to try to change you. Whateverland was written to get you to accept yourself even if you are a disorganized semi-hoarder, a Pop Tart eater, or someone who firmly believes in sex on the first date. <br><br> 5. Arrive: "What the Hell is Homekeeping?" Ponder the miseries of having a houseguest, being a houseguest, and having workmen (hot or, mostly, not) use your bathroom. Check out Jennifer's safe side of the bed theory and Alexis' explanation for why she is the way she is (being forced to leave New York City at a young age for a house in the wilds of Westport, Connecticut, in which the doors had no doorknobs). <br><br> 6. Depart: Homekeeping chapter. Arrive: "Does Talking to Pop-Tarts Mean You're Crazy?" Don't actually answer that question because Jenny and Alexis fight about it and about other food and eating-related topics, including chicken fingers, children's menus in restaurants, and when people go out to dinner in restaurants but don't order anything because they say they're not hungry even though it's really because they're dieting. <br><br> 7. Depart: Food chapter. Arrive: "Getting Married in a Gray Flannel Suit." See the photo that proves Alexis actually did get married in a gray flannel suit (complete with a priceless expression on Martha's face) and read how her honeymoon was the beginning of the end of her marriage. Listen to Jenny explain her "Irresistibility-to-Annoyingness Ratio" relationship survival theory. Leave chapter with a new and profound respect for the fact that any relationships ever work out and that you're not the only one who's crazy when it comes to dating and connecting in romantic relationships that often end in cheating. <br><br> 8. Rest stop. Take a few minutes to look at more pictures. Consider the photo of Alexis proudly holding one of her first pastry masterpieces (p. 207), Jenny-in-pigtails eating a giant candy apple (p. 28), the letter from Martha to Alexis at summer camp (p. 128), or the photo of Barbra Streisand enjoying Christmas with Jenny (p. 143). <br><br> 9. Back on the road. Depart: Marriage and Relationships chapter. Arrive: "Not a Hoarder, Still a Slob." This is one of those chapters you secretly bought the book for because it contains Alexis' secrets for organizing her home and closets. <br><br> 10. Enough with the cleaning and organizing. Back to sex. Arrive: "Should Sex Ever Involve Food?" Spoiler alert: No. Feel free to sleep with this chapter on the first date! It's that good. <br><br> 11. Depart: Sex and Dating chapter (no guilt or apologies necessary). Arrive: "Wrapping Your Own Christmas Presents." Read Alexis' and Jenny&#x2019;s epic, screamingly funny tales of growing up dysfunctional! Feel the full power of Whateverland start to take effect. You're not the only one who had a crazy childhood and a dysfunctional family. Important travel tip: don't forget the tissues&#x2014;there's some wonderfully weepy stuff here. <br><br> 12. Hungry? Perfect timing. Arrive: "What Do You Mean You 'Can't' Cook?" Understand how having Martha Stewart teach you and your friends how to cook while wearing little child-sized toques in your own house would probably have had a profound impact on you, too. And learn that some people think chicken on a Caesar salad is right (Jennifer) and some people think chicken on a Caesar salad is very very wrong (Alexis). Drool over a selection of Alexis' recipes, including the one for chocolate chip cookies she came up with at the age of thirteen. <br><br> 13. Travel alert: Ignore all signs for off ramps to Guilt. They will take you back to Shame and delay your journey. <br><br> 14. Arrive: "Drawing the Line at Fat Elbows." Another spoiler alert: Jenny did, and she lost over 70 pounds and changed her life. Body Image and Weight Loss chapter highlights include their unisex Rules for Looking Presentable and Not Repulsing People. <br><br> 15. Depart Body Image/Weight Loss. Arrive: Chapter 9: "The Devil Wore Palazzo Pants." You can certainly get fashion advice here but really, the highlight is the pictures. Hi. Freakin&#x2019;. Larious. <br><br> 16. Prepare for final stop in WHATEVERLAND: "You're Only as Sick as Your Secrets." This amazing chapter catalogues Alexis&#x2019;s and Jennifer's deepest, darkest secrets and personality quirks which should prove to you that learning to accept yourself for who you are -- however imperfect and odd you might be -- is the only way to go through the rest of your life. <br><br> 17. Park, check in, unpack your bags. You're going to like WHATEVERLAND and you won't want to go anywhere else. Enjoy. <br> <br> <br><b>Welcome to Whateverland!</b><p>In this special world, there's no such thing as shame, grim embarrassment, or TMI.

Images such as Delacroix&#39;s Liberty on the Barricades and Manet&#39;s Le Dejeuner sur l&#39;Herbe are so well known that the question of how the gendered body functions in them is often overlooked. In this detailed feminist art-historical study of the body in general and the nude in particular, Marcia Pointon explores the narrative structures of a series of major European and American paintings and other images, mapping her interpretations on the historiography of nineteenth-century painting and employing an innovative theoretical methodology to demonstrate how the visual representation of gendered bodies works to articulate power relations that are to be understood in terms of the symbolic and the psychic as part of the historical.</p><p>In this detailed feminist art-historical study of the body in general and the nude in particular, Marcia Pointon explores the narrative structures of a series of major European and American paintings and other images. Pointon employs an innovative methodology as well as mapping her interpretations on the historiography of nineteenth-century painting.This challenging book discusses intersubjectivity between painter, subject and viewer over the issue of gender in Western painting, concentrating mostly on the naked female body, the "range of viewing possibilities" its depiction creates, and how these "acts of interpretation" relate to the artist's political and psychosexual meaning. Pointon's prose often leaves the reader frustrated and dismayed: "The ways in which images work in terms of sexual oppression are determined by the relations between the viewing positions of spectators as gendered subjects and the viewing subjects as constructed in images through forms of visual rhetoric." The author puts a Freudian spin on Thomas Eakins's operating room tableaux, The Gross Clinic and The Agnew Clinic , she arbitrates views of Delacroix's Liberty on the Barricades as whore and heroine, and she determines the allegorical status of the naked picnicker in Manet's Le dejeuner sur l'herbe . Though there are insights aplenty, this collection of essays is crowded with peripheral facts and citations, the claustrophobic feeling exacerbated by Pointon's ( History of Art: A Student's Handbook ) narrow focus on a small number of works.

And indeed there is scarcely more than a passing mention of homosexuality in Foucault's scholarly writings. So why has Foucault, who died of AIDS in 1984, become a powerful source of both personal and political inspiration to an entire generation of gay activists? And why have his political philosophy and his personal life recently come under such withering, normalizing scrutiny by commentators as diverse as Camille Paglia, Richard Mohr, Bruce Bawer, Roger Kimball, and biographer James Miller?<br> <br> David M. Halperin's <em>Saint Foucault</em> is an uncompromising and impassioned defense of the late French philosopher and historian as a galvanizing thinker whose career as a theorist and activist will continue to serve as a model for other gay intellectuals, activists, and scholars. A close reading of both Foucault and the increasing attacks on his life and work, it explains why straight liberals so often find in Foucault only counsels of despair on the subject of politics, whereas gay activists look to him not only for intellectual inspiration but also for a compelling example of political resistance. Halperin rescues Foucault from the endless nature-versus-nurture debate over the origins of homosexuality ("On this question I have absolutely nothing to say," Foucault himself once remarked) and argues that Foucault's decision to treat sexuality not as a biological or psychological drive but as an effect of discourse, as the product of modern systems of knowledge and power, represents a crucial <em>political</em> breakthrough for lesbians and gay men. Halperin explains how Foucault's radical vision of homosexuality as a strategic opportunity for self-transformation anticipated the new anti-assimilationist, anti-essentialist brand of sexual identity politics practiced by contemporary direct-action groups such as ACT UP. Halperin also offers the first synthetic account of Foucault's thinking about gay sex and the future of the lesbian and gay movement, as well as an up-to-the-minute summary of the most recent work in queer theory.<br> <br> "Where there is power, there is resistance," Michel Foucault wrote in <em>The History of Sexuality, Volume I</em>. Erudite, biting, and surprisingly moving, <em>Saint Foucault</em> represents Halperin's own resistance to what he views as the blatant and systematic misrepresentation of a crucial intellectual figure, a misrepresentation he sees as dramatic evidence of the continuing personal, professional, and scholarly vulnerability of all gay activists and intellectuals in the age of AIDS.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <br> <strong>David M.

A founding editor of <em>GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and GayStudies</em>, and a coeditor of <em>The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader</em>, he is the author most notably of <em>One Hundred Years of Homosexuality</em>, which <em>Outweek</em> called "the single most important contribution to the interpretation of gay history in nearly a decade."<br><br>"Foucault, the worm having turned, needs defenders these days, and Halperin fills the position well, arguing that Foucault provides the radical gay movement with both the philosophical underpinnings and political means with which to resist suppression by mainstream culture."--<em>The Los Angeles Times</em> <em>Book Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>Saint Foucault</em> is not only the most stimulating analysis to date of 'the Foucault effect': it is a major contribution in its own right to the political effect of Foucault's work. It is required reading for everyone interested in Foucault's thought, in philosophical thought and contemporary politics, as well as everyone interested in Queer Theory and in the ongoing controversies and struggles of the gay movement."--Didier Eribon, author of <em>Michel Foucault</em> and <em>Michel Foucault et ses contemporains</em><p></p><br>"Without even setting out to do so, David Halperin has provided the most lucid explication of the later work of Foucault that I've read. As if this were not rebuke enough to those who have got it all wrong, Halperin goes on to demolish, point by point, those liberal critics and biographers who would make of Foucault that object of their homophobic knowingness. For all of that, the book's real utility resides in something more: its extraordinarily able demonstration of the ways that Foucault's strategies of resistance are enacted in queer political and cultural practices."--Douglas Crimp, author of <em>On the Museum's Ruins</em> and co-author of <em>AIDS Demo Graphics</em><p></p><br>"Bracingly clear-headed and endlessly smart, David Halperin's new book commands attention. <em>Saint Foucault</em> represents a major contribution to the philosophy of sexuality and a magisterial introduction to one of the twentieth century's most important thinkers. Unafraid to take real intellectual risks, Halperin delivers Foucault at last from the pedants and the purists, the doubters and the debunkers. A sage, searching, and sensible book."--Diana Fuss, Department of English, Princeton University and author of <em>Identification Papers</em><p></p><br>"For those concerned with the thought of Foucault and the politics of gayness, an absolutely necessary book."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Glaciation: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions)</h2><p>Vast, majestic, and often stunningly beautiful, glaciers lock up some 10% of the world's freshwater. These great bodies of ice play an important part in the Earth system, carving landscapes and influencing climate on regional and hemispheric scales, as well as having a significant impact on global sea level. Throughout time, the Earth has experienced various major glaciations in its deep history, long before the ice ages of the Quaternary, and the observed effects of climate change on glaciers have recently brought them to the forefront of public attention.<br> <br>This <em>Very Short Introduction</em> offers an overview of glaciers and ice sheets as systems, considering the role of geomorphology and sedimentology in studying them, and their impacts on our planet in terms of erosional and depositional processes. Looking at our glaciers today, and their ongoing processes, David Evans considers the extent to which we can use this knowledge in reconstructing and interpreting ancient glacial landscapes. <br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong> The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.<br></p><p><br><strong>David J A Evans</strong> is a glacial geomorphologist who specializes in glacial landsystems and their application to reconstructing past glaciations.

After a 14 year spell at the University of Glasgow he moved to Durham University in 2004, where he is part of a large glacial research group.<br></p><h2>Can Capitalism Survive?</h2><p><p>Benjamin A. Rogge&#x2014;late Distinguished Professor of Political Economy at Wabash College&#x2014;was a representative of that most unusual species: economists who speak and write in clear English. He forsakes professional jargon for clarity and logic&#x2014;and can even be downright funny. The nineteen essays in this volume explore the philosophy of freedom, the nature of economics, the business system, labor markets, money and inflation, the problems of cities, education, and what must be done to ensure the survival of free institutions and capitalism.</p></p><p>Benjamin A Rogge</p><h2>To Serve Them All My Days</h2><p>Young David Powlett-Jones, a Welsh miner&#39;s son, is invalided home from France when he suffers severe shell shock on the Western Front. At a remote English public school in Devon the debilitated veteran, himself barely out of his teens, decides temporarily to try his hand at teaching while striving to awaken from the nightmare of World War I -- the national catastrophe that sweeps England out of the comfortable certainties of the Victorian Age into the moral perplexities and harsh economic realities of more modern times.</p><p>R. F. Delderfield was born in South London in 1912. On leaving school he joined the Exmouth Chronicle newspaper as a junior reporter, where he went on to become Editor. From there he began to write stage plays and then became a highly successful novelist, renowned for brilliantly portraying slices of English life. With the publication of his first saga, A HORSEMAN RIDING BY, he became one of Britain&#39;s most popular authors. Many of his bestselling novels were later adapted for television. He died in 1972.<p>Excerpt from Chapter One </p> <p>The guard at Exeter warned him he would have to change at Dulverton to pick up the westbound train to Bamfylde Bridge Halt, the nearest railhead to the school, but did not add that the wait between trains was an hour. It was one of those trivial circumstances that played a part in the healing process of the years ahead, for the interval on that deserted platform, set down in a rural wilderness, and buttressed by heavily timbered hills where spring lay in ambush, gave Powlett-Jones an opportunity to focus his thoughts in a way he had been unable to do for months, since the moment he had emerged from the dugout and paused, rubbing sleep from his eyes, to glance left and right down the trench. From that moment, down long vistas of tortured, fearful and horribly confused dreams, his thoughts, if they could be recognised as thoughts, had been random pieces of a child's jigsaw, no two dovetailing, no half-handful forming a coherent pattern. Yet now, for a reason he could not divine, they coalesced and he was aware, on this account alone, of a hint of reprieve.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The shell, a coal-box, must have pitched directly on the parados of the nearest traverse, filling the air with screaming metal and raising a huge, spouting column of liquid mud. He had no real awareness of being flung backwards down the slippery steps, only a blessed certainty that this was it. Finish. Kaput. The end of three years of half-life, beginning that grey, October dawn in 1914, when his draft had moved up through a maze of shallow ditches to a waterlogged sector held by the hard-pressed Warwickshires they were relieving. Even then, after no more than two days in France, his sense of geography had been obliterated by desolation, by acres and acres of debris scattered by the sway of two battle-locked armies across the reeking mudflats of Picardy. There were no landmarks and not as many guidelines as later, when trench warfare became more sophisticated. The confusion, however, enlarged its grip on his mind as months and years went by, a sense of timelessness punctuated by moments of terror and unspeakable disgust, by long stretches of yammering boredom relieved by two brief respites, one in base hospital, recovering from a wound, the other when he was withdrawn for his commissioning course. Superiors, equals and underlings came and went. Thousands of khaki blurs, only a very few remaining long enough to make a lasting impression on him. Here and there he had made a friend, the kind of friend one read about in the classics, true, loyal, infinitely relished. But the mutter of the guns, the sour mists that seemed to hang over the battlefield in summer and winter, had swallowed them up as the wheels of war trundled him along, a chance survivor of a series of appalling shipwrecks.</p> <p>Occasionally, just occasionally, he would be aware of conventional time. The coming of a new season. A birthday or anniversary, when his memory might be jogged by a letter from home, full of mining-village trivia. But then the fog would close in again and home and the past seemed separated from him by thousands of miles and millions of years, a brief, abstract glimpse of links with a civilisation as dead as Nineveh's.</p> <p>And at the very end of it all that ultimate mortar shell, landing square on the parados and pitchforking him over the threshold of hell where, for the most part, he was unaware of his identity as a man or even a thing but floated free on a current of repetitive routines &#x2014; shifts on a stretcher or in a jolting vehicle; daily dressings, carried out by faceless men and women; odd, unrelated sounds like bells and the beat of train wheels; the rumble of voices talking a language he never understood; the occasional, sustained yell that might have signified anger, pain or even animal high spirits.</p> <p>The intervals of clarity and cohesion lengthened as time went on, but they were never long enough for him to get a firm grip on his senses. He learned, over the months, that he had been dug out alive, the only survivor of the blast, after being buried for several hours. Also that he had survived, God alone knew how, the long, jolting journey down the communication trenches to the dressing station, to advance base and finally to Le Havre and the hospital ferry. For a long time, however, he was unaware of being back in England, shunted from one hospital to another until he finally came to rest at Osborne, reckoned a convalescent among a thousand or more other shattered men as confused as himself.</p> <p>Then, but very slowly, he became fully aware of himself again. Second Lieutenant David Powlett-Jones, "A" Company, Third Battalion, South Wales Borderers; sometime Davy Powlett-Jones, son of Ewart and Glynnis, of No. 17 Aberglaslyn Terrace, Pontnewydd, Monmouthshire, a boy who had dreamed of scholarship and celebrity, of bringing a gleam of triumph into the eyes of a short, stocky miner who had worked all his life in a hole in the mountain and died there with two of his sons in the Pontnewydd-Powis explosion of August, 1913.</p> <p>He was aware of his identity and, to some extent, of his past and present, but the future was something else. He could never attach his mind to it for more than a few seconds. The war surely would go on for ever and ever, until every human soul in the world was engulfed in it. He could never picture himself leading any different kind of life but that of trudging to and from the line, in and out of the mutter of small-arms fire and the sombre orchestra of the shells. Hospital life, as he lived it now, was no more than an interval.</p> <p>Then Rugeley-Scott, the neurologist, infiltrated into his dream world. First as a white-smocked and insubstantial figure, no different from scores of predecessors who had paused, hummed and prodded during the last few months, but ultimately as a force where he could find not comfort exactly but at least relevance. For Rugeley-Scott had certain theories and persisted in putting them forward.</p> <p>One was his theory of upland air and David's own Celtic roots responded to this, feeding a little vitality into the husk of his flesh and bone. For Rugeley- Scott said that a man could enjoy a sense of proportion in upland air that was denied the Lowlander, upland air being keen and stimulating and capable of clearing the fog in the brain and reanimating petrified thought-processes. It had a trick, he said, of making a man at one with his environment. Rugeley-Scott, of course, was a Highlander, whose boyhood had been spent in Sutherland and whose medical studies had taken him no further south than Perthshire. He believed passionately in upland air in the way a primitive savage believes in the witch doctor's bones and amulets.</p> (20090930)</p><h2>The World of the Oxus Civilization (Routledge Worlds)</h2><p><p>This collection of essays presents a synthesis of current research on the Oxus Civilization, which rose and developed at the turn of the 3rd to 2nd millennia BC in Central Asia. </p> <p>First discovered in the 1970s, the Oxus Civilization, or the Bactria&#x2013;Margiana Archaeological Complex, has engendered many different interpretations, which are explored in this volume by an international group of archaeologists and researchers.

The astounding richness of the burials at the site of Gonur are testimony to the wealth and sophistication of this culture which flourished as part of the expansive network of trade and exchange that linked the riverine cultures of the Near East from Troy to the Indus valley." - <strong>Holly Pittman</strong>, <em>University of Pennsylvania, USA.</em></p> <p>"The <em>World of the Oxus Civilisation</em> brings to life one of the great &#x2018;lost civilisations&#x2019; of the ancient world, lost only because, while extraordinarily rich and extensive in its reach, its story has long been hidden from the broader world of scholarship by extreme political and linguistic barriers. This volume, telling the full story of the Oxus Civilisation for the first time, is a magnificent gift for anyone interested in the rich complexity of the ancient world and the early rise of internationalism across Asia. Its comprehensive coverage, presented as a series of specialist essays by a range of international scholars, will be warmly welcomed as a much needed authoritative work of reference filling a critical gap in the early history of Old World development, linking Eurasia with the greater Iranian world, the Indus Valley with Mesopotamia and placing Central Asia in its rightful position as a well spring of early cultural development." - <strong>Alison Betts</strong>, <em>University of Sydney, Australia.</em></p></p><h2>African Religions and Philosophy</h2><p><p><i>African Religions and Philosophy</i> is a systematic study of the attitudes of mind and belief that have evolved in the many societies of Africa.

Lincoln had hoped to realize his firm determination to preserve the Union through peaceful and nonprovocative measures. However, he was willing to accept war if he could avoid the blame for having started it. As events turned out, he was no more the aggressor than was Jefferson Davis. In these pages, Current retraces step by step the influences and events that shaped Lincoln&#39;s controversial April policy, beginning with the new president&#39;s rather furtive arrival in Washington and concluding with the mobilization for war. The Sumter question, as the author points out, &#34;reflects and in turn casts light upon the national tradition of avoiding the &#39;first shot.&#39; It concerns the events that led directly to the Civil War, the greatest of wars from the American point of view. And it involves problems of historical evidence and interpretation that have more fascination than even the best of ordinary puzzles.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Medicolegal Issues for Diagnostic Imaging Professionals, Fourth Edition</h2><p>Designed to enhance the work and study of radiographers and imaging specialists, this third edition provides critically relevant applications of the law from a radiographer&#39;s perspective.

Convicted as an accessory to the murder of a federal witness and that of a fellow drug dealer, Jonathan faced the death penalty, and Duck was there to provide evidence that the environment in which Jonathan had grown up mitigated the seriousness of his alleged crimes. Duck&#x2019;s exploration led him to Jonathan&#x2019;s church, his elementary, middle, and high schools, the juvenile facility where he had previously been incarcerated, his family and friends, other drug dealers, and residents who knew him or knew of him. After extensive ethnographic observations, Duck found himself seriously troubled and uncertain: Are Jonathan and others like him a danger to society? Or is it the converse&#x2014;is society a danger to them?<br> <br> Duck&#x2019;s short stay in Bristol Hill quickly transformed into a long-term study&#x2014;one that forms the core of <i>No Way Out</i>. This landmark book challenges the common misconception of urban ghettoes as chaotic places where drug dealing, street crime, and random violence make daily life dangerous for their residents. Through close observations of daily life in these neighborhoods, Duck shows how the prevailing social order ensures that residents can go about their lives in relative safety, despite the risks that are embedded in living amid the drug trade. In a neighborhood plagued by failing schools, chronic unemployment, punitive law enforcement, and high rates of incarceration, residents are knit together by long-term ties of kinship and friendship, and they base their actions on a profound sense of community fairness and accountability. Duck presents powerful case studies of individuals whose difficulties flow not from their values, or a lack thereof, but rather from the multiple obstacles they encounter on a daily basis.<br> <br> <i>No Way Out</i> explores how ordinary people make sense of their lives within severe constraints and how they choose among unrewarding prospects, rather than freely acting upon their own values. What emerges is an important and revelatory new perspective on the culture of the urban poor.</p></p><p><b>Waverly Duck</b> is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh.&#x201c;Remarkably original. <i>No Way Out </i>is deeply infused with knowledge of the ethnographic literature that has identified today&#x2019;s still acute policy issues in poor, urban, mostly black&#x2014;and often crime-ridden&#x2014;communities. To read this book is to be assaulted by the realities of Bristol Hill&#x2014;and other places like it&#x2014;and to become aware of the fine lines binding the heroic to the tragic in the lives of its people. <i>No Way Out </i>does what few other books of its kind do. It makes multiple contributions to the scholarship, while telling the stories of Bristol Hill in a way that is plain for anyone to understand.&#x201d; (<i>Charles Lemert, senior fellow, Urban Ethnography Project, Yale University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Original, thickly described, and well-written,&nbsp;<i>No Way Out&nbsp;</i>powerfully represents a world that outsiders rarely view up-close. Duck is the consummate urban ethnographer; he puts you there. Nothing short of brilliant&#x2014;this book is a remarkable achievement, and will become an enduring contribution to the urban literature.&#x201d; (<i>Elijah Anderson, author of Code of the Street and The Cosmopolitan Canopy</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;With skill, sagacity, and sensitivity, Duck delves beneath the hype that dominates perceptions of neighborhoods with street-based drug markets and sheds new light on the residents of one such area with evocative depth and complexity. Through this lucid portrait of daily life forged under the unfathomably harsh conditions of poverty in America, we come to understand the individual and collective strategies people develop to bear the unbearable by creating a sense of order and community. Yet resilience and fortitude cannot conquer the powerful societal forces that keep generation after generation confined to these oppressive territories. <i>No Way Out</i> is a haunting, thought-provoking read that lingers long after we turn the final page.&#x201d; (<i>Megan Comfort, author of Doing Time Together: Love and Family in the Shadow of the Prison</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Duck&#x2019;s research undeniably enriches the urban sociology and delinquency literature. The distinction that he outlines between the cultural codes of a neighborhood and its inhabitants&#x2019; personal values is particularly interesting. Indeed, several examples of empirical research measure culture by interrogating individual beliefs, interpreting expected social practices as what people really want for themselves.&#x201d; (<i>European Journal of Sociology</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>No Way Out</i> provides a sophisticated, nuanced, theoretical, and pragmatic understanding of lived experiences and social processes in a criminalized African American community. . . . It is a must-read for students of urban ethnography. Duck teaches us how to develop knowledge from multiple vantage points about the multiple realities that our participants live and experience; he teaches us to reflect critically on our positionality as knowledge producers, narrators, and theory creators; and he gives us a lesson in developing research with a purpose that is translational and aims to improve the conditions of the populations we study. . . . <i>No Way Out</i> gives us a solid way in. It teaches us to be nuanced and multidimensional about our research with marginalized populations, while giving us conceptual tools to continue to develop and build on as we move forward in our endeavor to understand justice, inequality, social process, and social change.&#x201d; (<i>Contemporary Sociology</i>)</p><h2>Our Molecular Nature: The Body&#x2019;s Motors, Machines and Messages</h2><p><b>Molecular Nature</b> is a richly illustrated guide to the extraordinary diversity of molecules that are responsible for life.

Using campaign finance data, original survey research, and hundreds of interviews with candidates and political insiders, Herrnson looks at how this dual strategy affects who wins and how it ultimately shapes the entire electoral system. The <strong>Seventh Edition</strong> considers the impact of the Internet and social media on campaigning; the growing influence of interest groups in the wake of the Supreme Court&#x2032;s <em>Citizens United</em> ruling; and the influence of new voting methods on candidate, party, and voter mobilization tactics.</p><p><p> <b>Paul S.

In 81 full-page maps designed by Rand McNally, the colors of the world are the colors of height and depth, ranging from white (above 9,842 feet) through brown, yellow, green, and aqua (sea level), to deeper and deeper blues. You can see at a glance the shallowness of the Yellow Sea and the mountainous nature of the center of Borneo. The fissures and slopes of the land are evident even before you can discern the place names. And unlike many atlases, this one is up-to-date, with Hong Kong appearing as part of China. There's also a chapter discussing and illustrating rocks, weather systems, and habitats, as well as a chart with facts relevant to the world's 192 independent countries. In <i>Illustrated Great World Atlas</i> a lot of information is made accessible for a modest price.In an ever-changing world, staying current can be difficult, but here are two atlases that try. Completely up-to-date, DK's handsome volume reflects the recent reversion of Zaire to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the return of Hong Kong to China. The moderate size (38 cm) is enhanced by the inclusion of eight large-scale fold-out maps of key regions. Full-color maps portray the world, continents, and regions with detailed, computerized terrain modeling. Thematic maps are the principal feature of the "World Today" survey of our planet but are also included at the continent level. Also included in alphabetical order are geographical data entries for all 192 independent nations. The official flags illustrated on the back endpaper are completely current and accurate, though it would have been preferable to include this feature within the volume since library processing could interfere with its use. The index-gazetteer includes 80,000 entries. The Reader's Digest editors commissioned Rand McNally to provide 81 custom full-color maps for their Illustrated Great World Atlas (also 38 cm). Coverage ranges from world maps down to regions and major population centers, with fine topographical details. The introductory "Story of the Earth" uses color illustrations and thematic maps to explain landforms, habitats, weather, and resources. The "Nations of the World" section provides geographical information for 192 independent countries arranged by region, including demographic and economic data, descriptive narrative, and official flags. The map index includes more than 40,000 entries. It should be noted that the flag of the Republic of Georgia is erroneously shown as that of Mali, and the maps and data are not completely current: Hong Kong is included as part of China, but Zaire remains. The similarity of both atlases is evident, and either one would be a useful reference resource for any library. However, the up-to-date DK World Atlas, with its extensive index, clearly has the edge.?Edward K. Werner, St. Lucie Cty. Lib. System, Ft.

It should be one of the best understood of human institutions, but it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s one of the worst understood, by both its advocates and detractors. Though it has been spurned by governments many times, this has never been due to a fault of gold to serve its duty, but because governments had other plans for their currencies beyond maintaining their stability. And so, says Nathan Lewis, there is no reason to believe that the great monetary successes of the past four centuries, and indeed the past four millennia, could not be recreated in the next four centuries. In <i>Gold,</i> he makes a forceful, well-documented case for a worldwide return to the gold standard. <p>Governments and central bankers around the world today unanimously agree on the desirability of stable money, ever more so after some monetary disaster has reduced yet another economy to smoking ruins. Lewis shows how gold provides the stability needed to foster greater prosperity and productivity throughout the world. He offers an insightful look at money in all its forms, from the seventh century B.C. to the present day, explaining in straightforward layman&#x2019;s terms the effects of inflation, deflation, and floating currencies along with their effect on prices, wages, taxes, and debt. He explains how the circulation of money is regulated by central banks and, in the process, demystifies the concepts of supply, demand, and the value of currency. And he illustrates how higher taxes diminish productivity, trade, and the stability of money. Lewis also provides an entertaining history of U.S. money and offers a sobering look at recent currency crises around the world, including the Asian monetary crisis of the late 1990s and the devastating currency devaluations in Russia, China, Mexico, and Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Lewis&#x2019;s ultimate conclusion is simple but powerful: gold has been adopted as money because it works. The gold standard produced decades and even centuries of stable money and economic abundance. If history is a guide, it will be done again.</p> <p><b>Nathan Lewis</b> was formerly the chief international economist of a firm that provided investment research for institutions. He now works for an asset management company based in New York. Lewis has written for the <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>Asian Wall Street</i> <i>Journal, Japan Times, Pravda,</i> and other publications. He has appeared on financial television in the United States, Japan, and the Middle East.</p></p><p><p>In the first years of this new century, the price of gold nearly tripled. Why should today's investors take notice? Because gold is the ultimate competitor to the U.S. dollar. In this age of increasing global competition and military conflict, ignoring the gold market could be devastating for anyone seeking to build wealth over the long run. A vote for gold is a vote against the dollar, against paper money . . . and paper assets. It's a way of saying,<i> "Yes, we know Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Bush, and Goldman Sachs are doing a good job, but it might be a good idea to have some REAL money, just in case."</i> </p><p>The world's commercial centers have used one or another variant of a gold standard for most of the last three millennia. And for good reason: gold forces governments to be fiscally responsible and it provides a stable environment for rapid economic growth as well as a safe environment for individual investors to grow their own wealth. </p><p>For the last thirty-five years, the U.S. government has been able to "print" money at will. If history is any guide, this government will do as all governments have in the past: overprint, causing the currency to crash. Inevitably, they will be forced to return to the gold standard, but at great expense and with considerable suffering. Investors who are not prepared will suffer the most. </p><p>Unfortunately, asserts Nathan Lewis, both advocates and detractors of the gold standard grossly misunderstand the inner workings of this human institution. In making his case for a return to the gold standard, Lewis takes a whirlwind tour of money in all its forms, from the seventh century B.C. to the present day, explaining in straightforward layman's terms the effects of inflation, deflation, and floating currencies along with their effect on prices, wages, taxes, and debt. </p><p>Lewis also provides an engaging history of U.S. money and offers a sobering look at recent currency crises around the world, including the Asian monetary crisis of the late 1990s and the devastating currency devaluations in Russia, China, Mexico, and Yugoslavia. And, in doing so, explains why making gold a part of your portfolio has never been more important than it is today. </p><p>The ultimate conclusion of <i>Gold: The Once and Future Money</i> is simple but powerful: the gold standard produced decades, even centuries, of solid money and economic abundance. If history is any guide, we can &#x2013;and should&#x2013;abandon this era of easy money and return to the stability of the gold standard.</p><p><b>NATHAN LEWIS</b> was formerly the chief international economist of a leading economic forecasting firm.

The riot that followed his arrival on campus seriously wounded scores of U.S. marshals and killed two civilians, more casualties than any other clash of the civil rights era. To restore order, the Kennedy administration dispatched thousands of soldiers to Oxford. In The Price of Defiance, Charles Eagles shows that the stunning eruption of violence resulted from the &#34;closed society&#39;s&#34; long defiance of the civil rights movement and federal law. Using many previously untapped sources, including FBI and U.S. marshal files, army and university records, and Meredith&#39;s personal papers, Eagles provides invaluable background for understanding the historic moment by demonstrating the university&#39;s--and Mississippi&#39;s--history of aggressive resistance to desegregation from the post@-World War II years on, including the delib</p><p>"Has the potential to teach us all a great deal about who Meredith was and is and about a transformational event in Mississippi's history."--Sid Salter, Jackson <i>Clarion-Ledger</i>, syndicated review <br>When James Meredith enrolled as the first African American student at the University of Mississippi in 1962, the resulting riots produced more casualties than any other clash of the civil rights era. Eagles shows that the violence resulted from the university&#39;s and the state&#39;s long defiance of the civil rights movement and federal law. Ultimately, the price of such behavior--the price of defiance--was not only the murderous riot that rocked the nation and almost closed the university but also the nation&#39;s enduring scorn for Ole Miss and Mississippi. Eagles paints a remarkable portrait of Meredith himself by describing his unusual family background, his personal values, and his service in the U.S. Air Force, all of which prepared him for his experience at Ole Miss.</p><h2>Modernity: An Introduction to Modern Societies</h2><p><i>Modernity: An Introduction to Modern Societies</i> is a new sociology textbook which provides a comprehensive and stimulating introduction to the history, sociology and ideas of modern society. It has been written for students and readers who have no prior knowledge of sociology, and is designed to be used in a variety of social science courses in universities and colleges.<br> <p>The book is divided into three parts, corresponding to the formation, consolidation and prospects of modernity. From the start, four major social processes are identified: the social, the cultural, the political, and the economic.

In most intellectual and artistic fields, Schorske argues, twentieth-century Europeans and Americans have come to do their thinking without history. Modern art, modern architecture, modern music, modern science--all have defined themselves not as emerging from or even reacting against the past, but as detached from it in a new, autonomous cultural space. This is in stark contrast to the historicism of the nineteenth century, he argues, when ideas about the past pervaded most fields of thought from philosophy and politics to art, music, and literature. However, Schorske also shows that the nineteenth century's attachment to thinking <i>with</i> history and the modernist way of thinking <i>without</i> history are more than just antitheses. They are different ways of trying to address the problems of modernity, to give shape and meaning to European civilization in the era of industrial capitalism and mass politics.</p><p>Schorske begins by reflecting on his own vocation as it was shaped by the historical changes he has seen sweep across political and academic culture. Then he offers a European sampler of ways in which nineteenth-century European intellectuals used conceptions of the past to address the problems of their day: the city as community and artifact; the function of art; social dislocation. Narrowing his focus to Fin-de-Si�cle Vienna in a second group of essays, he analyzes the emergence of ahistorical modernism in that city. Against the background of Austria's persistent, conflicting Baroque and Enlightenment traditions, Schorske examines three Viennese pioneers of modernism--Adolf Loos, Gustav Mahler, and Sigmund Freud--as they sought new orientation in their fields.</p><p>In a concluding essay, Schorske turns his attention to thinking <i>about</i> history. In the context of a postmodern culture, when other disciplines that had once abandoned history are discovering new uses for it, he reflects on the nature and limits of history for the study of culture.</p><p>Originally published in 1998.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.</p></p><p>As a tool for analysis, Carl E. Schorske writes, history can be used in two very different ways. We can study the past in order to "orient ourselves in the living present," in the hope, perhaps, of not reliving yesterday's tragedies. In doing so, we treat history as a static object and object lesson. Alternately, we can view our lives as part of a continuum, "linking or dissolving static elements in a narrative pattern of change," making history a living thing.<p> Either way, in Schorske's view, history takes center stage as a way to examine the human enterprise. In the essays contained in <i>Thinking with History</i>, he looks from both viewpoints into the beginnings of the modern era, writing of such groundbreaking artists and thinkers as Gustav Mahler, Richard Wagner, Sigmund Freud, and Rainer Maria Rilke, whose relationships with the dominant cultures of 19th- and early-20th-century Europe were frequently tense, and whose work constituted powerful critiques of their time. Schorske forges connections between our time and theirs, writing, for instance, that 1860, the year of Mahler's birth, was "the beginning of a heady liberal 'glasnost' and 'perestroika' ... in the Habsburg Empire." But he finds many differences, too, to suggest that some things do change with time, and even for the better. Schorske's book is a thoughtful look into the recent past, of particular value to readers with an interest in intellectual history and historiography. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Carl E.

Ferngren presents a comprehensive historical account of medicine and medical philanthropy in the first five centuries of the Christian era.</p><p>Ferngren first describes how early Christians understood disease. He examines the relationship of early Christian medicine to the natural and supernatural modes of healing found in the Bible. Despite biblical accounts of demonic possession and miraculous healing, Ferngren argues that early Christians generally accepted naturalistic assumptions about disease and cared for the sick with medical knowledge gleaned from the Greeks and Romans.</p><p>Ferngren also explores the origins of medical philanthropy in the early Christian church. Rather than viewing illness as punishment for sins, early Christians believed that the sick deserved both medical assistance and compassion. Even as they were being persecuted, Christians cared for the sick within and outside of their community. Their long experience in medical charity led to the creation of the first hospitals, a singular Christian contribution to health care.</p></p><p><p><b>Gary B.

He is the author of <i>Medicine and Religion: A Historical Introduction</i> and the editor of <i>Science and Religion: A Historical Introduction.</i></p><p>"A succinct, thoughtful, well-written, and carefully argued assessment of Christian involvement with medical matters in the first five centuries of the common era... It is to Ferngren's credit that he has opened questions and explored them so astutely. This fine work looks forward as well as backward; it invites fuller reflection of the many senses in which medicine and religion intersect and merits wide readership."</p> (<i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>)<br><br><p>"In this superb work of historical and conceptual scholarship, Ferngren unfolds for the reader a cultural milieu of healing practices during the early centuries of Christianity... His arguments are always compelling and usually convincing. He shows how Christians lived out their faith as a positive healing and caring witness, boldly living out their Christianity as a persuasive alternative to the failed pagan responses to fellow human beings in need."</p> (<i>Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith</i>)<br><br><p>"Readable and widely researched... an important book for mission studies and American Catholic movements, the book posits the question of what can take its place in today's challenging religious culture."</p> (<i>Missiology: An International Review</i>)<br><br><p>"This is an important book, for students of Christian theology who understand health and healing to be topics of theological interest, and for health care practitioners who seek a historical perspective on the development of the ethos of their vocation."</p> (<i>Journal of Religion and Health</i>)<br><br><p>"Medical historians and historians interested in the classical age will welcome this well written book to their libraries.

Tzara became Tzara twenty years later at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich, when he and others (including Marcel Janco, Hugo Ball, Richard Huelsenbeck, and Hans Arp) invented Dada with a series of chaotic performances including multilingual (and nonlingual) shouting, music, drumming, and calisthenics. Within a few years, Dada (largely driven by Tzara) became an international artistic movement, a rallying point for young artists in Paris, New York, Barcelona, Berlin, and Buenos Aires. With <i>TaTa Dada</i>, Marius Hentea offers the first English-language biography of this influential artist. </p><p>As the leader of Dada, Tzara created &#x201c;the moment art changed forever.&#x201d; But, Hentea shows, Tzara and Dada were not coterminous. Tzara went on to publish more than fifty books; he wrote one of the great poems of surrealism; he became a recognized expert on primitive art; he was an active antifascist, a communist, and (after the Soviet repression of the Hungarian Revolution) a former communist. Hentea offers a detailed exploration of Tzara's early life in Romania, neglected by other scholars; a scrupulous assessment of the Dada years; and an original examination of Tzara's life and works after Dada. The one thing that remained constant through all of Tzara's artistic and political metamorphoses, Hentea tells us, was a desire to unlock the secrets and mysteries of language.</p></p><p>Marius Hentea, a Romanian-born literary scholar, is an Associate Professor of English Literature at the University of Gothenburg. He is the author of <i>Henry Green at the Limits of Modernism.</i><p>Hentea's biography succeeds in capturing the effervescence of its subject, without being willing to take Tzara invariably at his own word; rarely succeeding, thankfully, in pinning him down, it does catch, in flashes, his essence like lightning in a bottle as he speeds by on his celestial adventures.</p>&#x2015;<i>Bookslut</i><br><br><p>It is rather shocking that it took almost a 100 years after the 'official' 1916 start of Dada in Zurich for a first comprehensive biography to be published in English on its main instigator Tristan Tzara. Beautifully designed and with a title worthy of this poet that points to his first ever published book <i>La Premi�re Aventure c�leste de Monsieur Antipyrine</i>, it makes for a truly enticing read.</p>&#x2015;<b>Edith Doove</b>, <i>Leonardo Reviews</i><br><br><p>The antics of the Dadaists, at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich in 1916 and after the war in various European cities, are notorious. What they actually signified is more problematic, and there is much to be learnt from this carefully documented and extensively illustrated biography of the Rumanian-born Tristan Tzara, who played a key role in the movement.</p>&#x2015;<b>Ian Birchall</b>, <i>Review 31</i><br><br><p>Marius Hentea has gone into a great deal of detail to tell Tzara's story and his book is well-researched (there are fifty pages of notes) and is a mine of information about Dada and surrealist events, little magazines, small-presses, and a variety of ephemeral publications.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jim Burns</b>, <i>The Northern Review of Books</i><br><br><p><i>TaTa Dada</i> offers a treasure trove of local insights (including the old riddle of the origins of the 'Tristan Tzara' moniker), but the book comes into its own as a reassessment of the history of Dada itself&#x2015;of the movement's origins, as well as of its often contradictory artistic aims. Besides its considerable merits as a biography and an astute historical account of Dadaism, Hentea's book offers a much-needed re-evaluation of the place of the Central European avant-gardes in the development of what we have come to call, in reductive shorthand, 'modernism.'</p>&#x2015;<i>Modernism/Modernity</i><br><br><p>Marius Hentea has given us what will probably be the book in English on Tristan Tzara for some time: splendidly written, thoroughly researched, balanced and sophisticated, and infected by his subject's creative energy. With its eye-catching design and generous illustrations, there is also something distinctly Dada about <i>TaTa Dada</i>, for which the publishers deserve their fair share of praise.</p>&#x2015;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><h2>The Scots and the Union: Then and Now</h2><p>Public opinion in Scotland in 1707 was sharply divided, between advocates of Union, opponents, and a large body of "don't knows". In 1706-7 it was party (and dynastic) advantage that was the main reason for opposition to the proposed union at elite level. Whatever the reasons now for maintaining the Union, they are in some important respects different from those which took Scotland into the Union, such as French aggression, securing the Revolution of 1688-89 and the defence of Protestantism. This new edition assesses the impact of the Union on Scottish society, including the bitter struggle with the Jacobites for acceptance of the union in the two decades that followed its inauguration. The book offers a radical new interpretation of the causes of union.<br><br>Now, as in 1706-7, some kind of harmonious relationship with England has to be settled upon. There exists, on both sides of the border, mutual antipathy but also powerful bonds, of language, kin, and economics. In the case of Scotland there is a strong sense of being "different" from England--a separate nation. But arguably this was even more powerful in the mid-19th century when demand grew not for independence but Home Rule. As in 1707, economic considerations are central, even if the nature of these now are different--the Union was forged in an era of "muscular mercantilism". Perceptions of economic gain and loss affected behaviour in 1706-7 and continue to affect attitudes to the Union today. This new edition lends historical weight to the present-day arguments for and against Union.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christopher A.

Kane also defends a traditional libertarian or incompatibilist view of free will (one that insists upon the incompatibility of free will and determinism), employing arguments that are both new to philosophy and that respond to contemporary developments in physics and biology, neuro science, and the cognitive and behavioral sciences.<br></p><p>In the past quarter-century, there has been a resurgence of interest in traditional philosophical questions about free will. The first of this book&#39;s aims is to explore the significance of this recent work, both for the advancement of understanding in one of philosophy&#39;s most perennially challenging areas, and for broad contemporary concerns in ethics, politics, science, religion, and humanistic studies. The book&#39;s second goal is to defend a classic &#34;incompatibilist&#34; or &#34;libertarian&#34; conception of free will in ways that are both new to philosophy and that respond to contemporary scientific learning. Incompatibilist or libertarian accounts of freedom are often criticized for being unintelligible or for having no place in the modern scientific picture of the world. Kane asserts to the contrary that a traditional view of free will (one that insists upon the incompatibility of free will and determinism) can be supported without the usual appeals to obscure or mysterious forms of agency and can be reconciled with recent developments in the sciences - physical, biological, neurological, cognitive, and behavioral.Robert Kane is at University of Texas at Austin.</p><h2>The Forest of Love: A Love Story in Blank Verse</h2><p>Poems by the well-known actor reveal all the stages of a love affair with a woman and with nature</p><p>Jack Palance has appeared in over 56 films, eight plays, and in over 50 television programs.

The tall ugly buildings were gone and Taras rode the steppes in search of a vanishing dream. Freedom. He was never able to find it, but he never lost the dream. All about me the flora grew quickly, so quickly, and a young doe ate fallen fruit. Somewhere a distant voice, we need you. Please come. Somewhere a body moving, gently moving -- touching, searching, entering. Entering a forest of love. We need you, please come. Faces! Faces with mouths open wide: screaming, laughing, calling. Insanity all about me -- the rope, the gun, which? Ten thousand starlings moving toward the rookery, moving thru the darkness that shelters their home. Darkness, hiding the ugliness of a deafening city, awaiting impatiently the next coming, the ultimate tremble. Now I lay me down, down, down. A city recycled, its spirit force clamoring: I want to be beautiful.

Why did the U.K. financial industry show its fastest expansion ever at the end of 2008&#x2015;just as the world&#x2019;s financial system went into meltdown? And why was Greece&#x2019;s chief statistician charged with treason in 2013 for apparently doing nothing more than trying to accurately report the size of his country&#x2019;s economy? The answers to all these questions lie in the way we define and measure national economies around the world: Gross Domestic Product. This entertaining and informative book tells the story of GDP, making sense of a statistic that appears constantly in the news, business, and politics, and that seems to rule our lives&#x2015;but that hardly anyone actually understands.</p><p>Diane Coyle traces the history of this artificial, abstract, complex, but exceedingly important statistic from its eighteenth- and nineteenth-century precursors through its invention in the 1940s and its postwar golden age, and then through the Great Crash up to today. The reader learns why this standard measure of the size of a country&#x2019;s economy was invented, how it has changed over the decades, and what its strengths and weaknesses are. The book explains why even small changes in GDP can decide elections, influence major political decisions, and determine whether countries can keep borrowing or be thrown into recession. The book ends by making the case that GDP was a good measure for the twentieth century but is increasingly inappropriate for a twenty-first-century economy driven by innovation, services, and intangible goods.</p></p><p><p>"Diane Coyle renders GDP accessible and introduces a much-needed historical perspective to the discourse of what we measure and why. A must-read for those interested in the far-reaching impact of GDP on the global economy, just as we seek ways to go beyond it."<b>--Angel Gurr�a, secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</b></p><p>"Countries are judged by their success in producing GDP. But what is it and where do those numbers reported on television come from? Diane Coyle makes GDP come to life--we see its strengths and its fallibilities, and we learn to understand and respect both."<b>--Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, 2003-2013</b></p><p>"This is an engaging and witty but also profoundly important book. Diane Coyle clearly and elegantly explains the fundamental difficulties of GDP--and how this headline figure is liable to radical change by apparently simple changes in method. She also provides a nice treatment of alternative proposals such as happiness surveys."<b>--Harold James, author of <i>Making the European Monetary Union</i></b></p><p>"Well written, interesting, and useful, this book will appeal to many readers. I learned a lot from it."<b>--Robert Hahn, University of Oxford</b></p><p>"<i>GDP: A Brief But Affectionate History</i> is a fascinating 140-page book that I cannot recommend highly enough.

There is no knowledge without objectivity of the intelligence; there is no freedom without objectivity of the will; and there is no nobility without objectivity of the soul . . . Esoterism seeks to realize pure and direct objectvity; this is its raison d'etre." <p>These are the opening words of a work in which the author explains why esoterism is both possible and necessary. It is the intellectual principle capable of explaining the formal contradictions of the various orthodox religions as well as the errors of materialistic and deconstructionist modern thought. In addition, esoterism is the way by which man may realize his connection with absolute Truth or Reality, despite the confusions and obstacles with which technological civilization and its philosophy seek to obscure our vision and weaken our resolve. In the author's words, "Just as rationalism can remove faith, so esoterism can restore it."</p></p><p>Frithjof Schuon is best known as the foremost spokesman of the religio perennis and as a philosopher in the metaphysical current of Shankara and Plato. Over the past 50 years, he has written more than 20 books on metaphysical, spiritual and ethnic themes as well as having been a regular contributor to journals on comparative religion in both Europe and America. Schuon's writings have been consistently featured and reviewed in a wide range of scholarly and philosophical publications around the world, respected by both scholars and spiritual authorities. <p>Schuon was born in 1907 in Basle, Switzerland, of German parents. As a youth, he went to Paris, where he studied for a few years before undertaking a number of trips to North Africa, the Near East and India in order to contact spiritual authorities and witness traditional cultures. Following World War II, he accepted an invitation to travel to the American West, where he lived for several months among the Plains Indians, in whom he has always had a deep interest. Having received his education in France, Schuon has written all his major works in French, which began to appear in English translation in 1953. Of his first book, The Transcendent Unity of Religions (London, Faber &amp; Faber) T.S. Eliot wrote: "I have met with no more impressive work in the comparative study of Oriental and Occidental religion." </p><p>The traditionalist or "perennialist" perspective began to be enunciated in the West at the beginning of the twentieth century by the French philosopher Rene Guenon and by the Orientalist and Harvard professor Ananda Coomaraswamy. Fundamentally, this doctrine is the Sanatana Dharma--the "eternal religion"--of Hindu Vedantists. It was formulated in the West, in particular, by Plato, by Meister Eckhart in the Christian world, and is also to be found in Islam with Sufism. Every religion has, besides its literal meaning, an esoteric dimension, which is essential, primordial and universal. This intellectual universality is one of the hallmarks of Schuon's works, and it gives rise to many fascinating insights into not only the various spiritual traditions, but also history, science and art. </p><p>The dominant theme or principle of Schuon's writings was foreshadowed in his early encounter with a Black marabout who had accompanied some members of his Senegalese village to Switzerland in order to demonstrate their culture. When the young Schuon talked with him, the venerable old man drew a circle with radii on the ground and explained: "God is in the center, all paths lead to Him."</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Basic Well Log Analysis, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Basic Well Log Analysis is a general introduction to common openhole logging measurements, both wire line and MWD/LWD, and the interpretation of those measurements to determine the traditional analytical goals of porosity, fluid saturation, and lithology/mineralogy.

Yeats</h2><p>Ann Saddlemyer's biography of W. B. Yeats's wife, George, portrays an extraordinarily talented, intelligent, and self-effacing woman, whose creative influence has never before been fully understood. She was wife and manager of a famous poet, and mother to his children, but in her own right also an inspired visionary and a practical woman of the arts. Georgie Hyde Lees was raised in London's literary salons, where arts, anthroposophy and the occult met. An accomplished linguist, art student and literary scholar, she married W. B. Yeats when she was 25, and he 52. Her supernatural "automatic writing" became the inspiration of Yeats's poetry and thought for the last 20 years of his life, yet she always concealed the depth of their collaboration. Close friend of many writers and poets, among them Frank O'Connor and Ezra Pound, she spent her long widowhood steering the "Yeats industry" and actively assisting younger scholars and writers.<br> <br> For the first time, this intelligent and creative woman is allowed to take center stage. Drawing on memoirs and a wealth of unknown and unpublished sources, this biography by the distinguished scholar Ann Saddlemyer reveals someone much more significant than just '"Mrs. W. B. Yeats"--a personality at once visionary and practical, and an important figure in twentieth-century literary history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ann Saddlemyer</strong> is Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto. She is one of the General Editors of the Cornell Yeats series (publishing the MSS of the entire Yeats canon); and on the editorial boards of the Canadian Journal of Irish Studies, the Irish Studies Review, the Irish University Review, the Correspondence of Bernard Shaw, and the Shaw Annual; and co-founder of the journal <em>Theatre Research in Canada</em>. She was awarded the British Academy's Rose Mary Crawshay Award for Criticism for her <em>Collected Letters of John Millington Synge</em> (OUP).<br><br>"Majestic.... In Saddlemyer, George Yeats has found a biographer perfectly suited to her.... Steeped in its subject, [the book] also provides an excellent, detailed portrait of the poet's life in his last two decades, far better than Yeats' own biographers have done. <em>Becoming George</em> is a delight to read: authoritative, sympathetic and insightful, it stands as a refreshing contrast to the overheated 'Yeats's Ghosts' (1999).... This is good, straightforward, old-fashioned biography, packed with information and useful for the Yeats aficionado and the novice reader alike."--Martin Rubin, <em>The San</em> <em>Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"Ann Saddlemyer has written a profound, exhaustive, and richly evocative life of this truly remarkable woman.... In drawing her subject forward into the light Saddlemyer has exercised an admirable discretion and sense of balance along with an almost fierce devotion to the facts. <em>Becoming George</em> is...the product, surely, of a lifetime of study and thought and discrimination. As a young scholar...Saddlemyer came to know George Yeats, and was a good friend of her daughter Anne, and the warmth of affection for George and the Yeats family permeates the book and brings it to life."--John Banville, <em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Saddlemyer has at last delivered the life of this remarkable woman in encyclopaedic detail.... Saddlemyer is gratifyingly frank in discussing Georgie's psychological make-up."--Brenda Maddox, <em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Saddlemyer's wise, majestic biography...is a masterpiece, an extraordinary achievement."--<em>The Globe and Mail</em><p></p><br>"Advanced reader will appreciate the copious endnotes and a view of a side Yeats absent from other biographies"--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"Uncommonly readable, marked by an acuity of emotional and literary insight...fun to read." --<em>The Nation</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Fathers of the Bible: A Devotional</h2><p>When we take a Bible in our hands, we are actually holding a user&#39;s manual for fathers. Story after story, it reveals our heavenly Father&#39;s love for his Son---and for us. It also shares the accounts of earthly fathers whose examples we&#39;ll want to either imitate or avoid. The twelve chapters in Fathers of the Bibleoffer slices from the biblical stories of men who were fathers. From them, we can learn something about the tasks, privileges, challenges, and failures of fatherhood. We&#39;ll discover the faithfulness of Noah, the conniving of Jacob, the unbridled passion of David, and the quiet confidence of Joseph, Jesus&#39; earthly father. Each of these men were dads. Their geographic settings and life circumstances were vastly different from ours, but the struggles and challenges of fatherhood are remarkably similar. Designed for personal prayer and study or for use in small groups, Fathers of the Biblewill help you ground your relationship with your children on God&#39;s Word.</p><p><b>Walking with Christ</b>No one can take a father's place in the life of his child. Being a dad challenges us, builds on our strengths, exposes our weaknesses, and--if we let it--helps us grow in our walk with Christ.Vital, real, and colorful, the men portrayed in this book offer the same mixture of virtues and flaws we find in ourselves. As you read about them, you will be inspired by their successes, challenged by their failures, and surprised by the fresh insight they bring to your own high calling as a dad.&nbsp;Adapted from <i>Men of the Bible</i>, this book furnishes a unique interactive experience. Each chapter becomes a personal retreat as you focus on the life of a particular biblical father and discover what you can learn from his life.&nbsp;<p>Robert Wolgemuth has been in the media business for thirty-nine years.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>What really happened in the Marabar caves? This is the mystery at the heart of E.M. Forster's 1924 novel, <i>A Passage to India</i>, the puzzle that sets in motion events highlighting an even larger question: Can an Englishman and an Indian be friends? <p> "It is impossible here," an Indian character tells his friend, Dr. Aziz, early in the novel. </p><blockquote> "They come out intending to be gentlemen, and are told it will not do.... Why, I remember when Turton came out first. It was in another part of the Province. You fellows will not believe me, but I have driven with Turton in his carriage--Turton! Oh yes, we were once quite intimate. He has shown me his stamp collection. <p> "He would expect you to steal it now. Turton! But red-nosed boy will be far worse than Turton! </p><p> "I do not think so. They all become exactly the same, not worse, not better. I give any Englishman two years, be he Turton or Burton. It is only the difference of a letter. And I give any Englishwoman six months. All are exactly alike." </p></blockquote> Written while England was still firmly in control of India, Forster's novel follows the fortunes of three English newcomers to India--Miss Adela Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Cyril Fielding--and the Indian, Dr. Aziz, with whom they cross destinies. The idea of true friendship between the races was a radical one in Forster's time, and he makes it abundantly clear that it was not one that either side welcomed. If Aziz's friend, Hamidullah, believed it impossible, the British representatives of the Raj were equally discouraging. <blockquote> "Why, the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die," said Mrs. Callendar.<br> "How if he went to heaven?" asked Mrs. Moore, with a gentle but crooked smile.<br> "He can go where he likes as long as he doesn't come near me. They give me the creeps." </blockquote> Despite their countrymen's disapproval, Miss Quested, Mrs. Moore, and Mr. Fielding are all eager to meet Indians, and in Dr. Aziz they find a perfect companion: educated, westernized, and open-minded. Slowly, the friendships ripen, especially between Aziz and Fielding. Having created the possibility of esteem based on trust and mutual affection, Forster then subjects it to the crucible of racial hatred: during a visit to the famed Marabar caves, Miss Quested accuses Dr. Aziz of sexually assaulting her, then later recants during the frenzied trial that follows. Under such circumstances, affection proves to be a very fragile commodity indeed. <p> Arguably Forster's greatest novel, <i>A Passage to India</i> limns a troubling portrait of colonialism at its worst, and is remarkable for the complexity of its characters. Here the personal becomes the political and in the breach between Aziz and his English "friends," Forster foreshadows the eventual end of the Raj. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Scratchboard for Illustration</h2><p>Scratchboard is a basic illustration technique that is currently undergoing a popular revival.

Text contains underlining. Covers show very minor shelving wear. Binding is tight, hinges strong. Dust jacket shows edge wear.</p><p>An authorised reissue of the long out of print classic textbook, Advanced Calculus by the late Dr Lynn Loomis and Dr Shlomo Sternberg both of Harvard University has been a revered but hard to find textbook for the advanced calculus course for decades. <p> This book is based on an honors course in advanced calculus that the authors gave in the 1960's. The foundational material, presented in the unstarred sections of Chapters 1 through 11, was normally covered, but different applications of this basic material were stressed from year to year, and the book therefore contains more material than was covered in any one year. It can accordingly be used (with omissions) as a text for a year's course in advanced calculus, or as a text for a three-semester introduction to analysis. </p><p> The prerequisites are a good grounding in the calculus of one variable from a mathematically rigorous point of view, together with some acquaintance with linear algebra. The reader should be familiar with limit and continuity type arguments and have a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. As possible introductory texts, we mention Differential and Integral Calculus by R Courant, Calculus by T Apostol, Calculus by M Spivak, and Pure Mathematics by G Hardy.

This timely collection of critical essays and creative pieces addresses several thought-provoking questions on the subject. For instance, as this so-called crisis is but the latest of many, what part has &#x201c;crisis&#x201d; played in the humanities&#x2019; history? How are artists, art historians, and professionals in related disciplines responding to current pressures to prove their worth? How does one defend the practical value of knowing how to think deeply about objects and images without losing the intellectual intensity that characterizes the best work in the discipline? Does art history as we know it have a future?<br></p><p>This timely assessment examines the role of art history within the so-called humanities crisis, what the crisis means, and how this emergency could shape the future of the field.<br><b>David Breslin </b>is John R.

The book, comprised of selected reports from Marathon Asset Management, a successful global investment firm, explains how shareholder value - the notion that companies should be run in the interests of their shareholders - became corrupted in this era of frenzied finance. Senior managers, succumbing to the lure of stock option fortunes, took to manipulating their company&#39;s earnings. Professional investors, interested only in maintaining their investment performance over the next quarter, were willing abettors. The &#39;croupiers&#39; of Wall Street, also know as investment bankers, whipped up the euphoria and peddled to investors superficially plausible stories, &#39;MacGuffins&#39;, in order to generate huge fees for themselves. As a result, by the turn of the century almost the entire investment community had become fixated with chasing short-term profits at the expense of long-term returns for clients. By the end of 2002 this cynical game had ended in investment disaster- the world&#39;s stock markets having produced more than $15 trillion of losses since their peak. Yet to a large extent, the outcome was predictable to those investors who had retained a disciplined approach to investment analysis throughout the bull market. This book introduces the &#39;capital cycle&#39; approach to investment - an approach that brings together ideas from the fields of behavioral finance, economic theory and business analysis. Capital cycle analysis - based on the apparently simple insight that investor euphoria leads to excessive investment in the real world and subsequent poor returns for shareholders - enabled Marathon to identify at an early stage the inevitable collapse of the technology and telecoms bubble.</p><p>Edward Chancellor is the author of Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation (FSG, 1999), a New York Times `Notable Book of the Year� and recently ranked as one of six indispensable investment classics by Money magazine.

The Deaconess Movement posed a threat to the accepted gender order of Victorian society, creating new spheres of activity and roles of authority for women outside the home. This volume, bringing together documents on the Movement from a variety of unpublished archives, offers an introduction to a neglected aspect of women&#39;s involvement in official Church ministry through the women&#39;s own voices. It provides a coherent illustration of the circumstances which fostered the revival of an ancient order of ministry for women, through the first-hand experience of some of the individuals who were involved in the early years. Socially divisive, theologically controversial, the claims of women to be part of an order analogous to that of the male diaconate formed the basis of their active participation in the ecclesiastical hierarchy right up to the present day.</p><p>Meticulously edited, this volume offers valuable material for the history of the Church of England. JOURNAL OF ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORYThis excellent selection of documents gives us a view of the early days of the Anglican Deaconess movement. DISTINCTIVE DIACONATE The book encourages historians to reassess the impact and significance of the revival of the female diaconate. Effectively contextualised by an informative, detailed introduction, and featuring the writing of women such as Isabella Gilmore and her more familiar counterpart Elizabeth Ferard, this volume will undoubtedly allow scholars to begin this important re-evaluation. This volume will better enable scholars to determine the complexity and significance of this process.

As early as the 1960&#39;s, I.M. Gelfand and his colleagues in the USSR thought hard about this same question and developed a style for presenting basic mathematics in a clear and simple form that engaged the curiosity and intellectual interest of thousands of high school and college students.

Thus, drawing graphs is shown to be one way to &#34;see&#34; formulas and functions and to observe the ways in which they change.

Vividly written and filled with dazzling insights, this unique book explores the cultural history of superweapons from Robert Fulton's eighteenth-century submarine through the strategic bomber and atomic bomb to Star Wars. H. Bruce Franklin tellingly reveals how and why the American quest for the ultimate defensive weapon--guaranteed to end all war and bring universal triumph to American ideals--has led to the creation of forces increasingly capable of automated global annihilation.<br> Franklin explores over two hundred movies, novels, and stories, from obscure pre-World War I fiction that influenced Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan to such modern classics as <em>Catch-22</em>, <em>Slaughterhouse Five</em>, and <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>. He demonstrates how the American imagination continually shapes ingenious new superweapons while engendering their antitheses in art and action. With its brilliant interweaving of culture, science, technology, and history, <em>War Stars</em> has received high praise from scientists, literary scholars, film critics, activists, and historians alike.</p><p><br><strong>H.

His poetry demonstrates how a poet must be a sharp perceptive observer of the complexity of the human condition. Perhaps his most moving poetry was written to express his feelings for his wife, the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in which he deals in a very &#39;modern&#39; way with the uncomfortable fact that we can never quite bridge the gap between ourselves and the people we love.</p><p>The aim of this edition is to present all the volumes and pamphlets of poetry which Browning published up to the year 1864, in the order in which they first made their appearance. The text, however, is that of the collected edition which he published at the end of his life.Robert Browning (1812-1889) was born in Camberwell, London, the son of a clerk in the Bank of England. The strongest influence on his education were the books in his father's extensive library, particularly the writings of Byron and Shelley. His dramatic poem "Paracelsus," published in 1835, established his reputation and brought him the friendship of the actor-manager William Macready. When Macready's eldest son Willie was ill in bed, Browning wrote for the boy's entertainment the poem of The Pied Piper, a story he remembered from his own childhood. After its appearance in print in 1842, it became a children's classic, attracting new illustrators in every generation. <br>In 1846 Robert Browning married a fellow poet, Elizabeth Barrett, eloping with her to Italy where they lived until Elizabeth's death in 1861. He them returned to England to live with his only sister Sarianna, but later he went back to Italy, where he died at the Rezzonico Palace in Venice.</p><h2>Atlas of General Surgical Techniques: Expert Consult &#x2013; Online and Print</h2><p><p>Atlas of General Surgical Techniques covers the full spectrum and breadth of general surgery through nearly 1200 easy-to-follow anatomic drawings.

Its size, influence, and multicultural composition mark it as a corner-stone of our country. The rich and varied history of early New York would seem to present a fertile topic for investigation to those interested colonial America. Yet, there has never been a modern history of old New York--until this lively and detailed account by Michael Kammen. <br> Gracefully written and comprehensive in scope, <em>Colonial New York</em> includes all of the political, social, economic, cultural, and religious aspects of New York's formative centuries. Social and ethnic diversity have always been characteristic of New York, and this was never so evident as in its early years. This period provides the contemporary reader with a backward glance at what the United States would become in the twentieth-century. Colonial New York stood as a precursor of American society and culture as a whole: a broad model of the American experience we witness today.<br> Kammen's history is enlivened by a look at some of the larger-than-life personalities who had tremendous impact on the many social and political adjustments necessary to the colony's continued growth. Here we meet Peter Stuyvesant, director of New Netherland and an executive of the West India Company--a man facing the innumerable difficulties of governing a large, sprawling colony divided by Dutch, English, and Indian settlements. Ultimately, history would view him as a failure, but his strong, Calvinist approach left such an indelible stamp on the burgeoning colony that readers will be tempted to do a little revisionist thinking about his tenure. Looking at a later governor, Lord Cornbury, gives us the very opposite example of a man despised by his contemporaries as the most venal of all the colonial governors (he was an occasional public cross-dresser, wearing the clothes of his distant cousin, Queen Anne), but who forcefully guided the colony through a transition to Anglican rule. The book culminates in chapters that investigate New York's strategic role in the bloody French and Indian War, and the key part it played in the economic protests and political conflict that finally led to American independence. <br> The intricate and tangled web of alliances, loyalties, and shifting political ground that underlies much of colonial New York's past has clearly daunted many historians from taking on the task of writing an understandable account. Michael Kammen has accepted this challenge and gives us much more than a mere chronicle. Rather, he paints a compelling portrait of colonial life as it truly was. Although this important book is thorough and informed by primary sources, <em>Colonial New York</em>'s clear and vivid prose offers a delightful narrative that will entertain both general readers and serious scholars alike. It pays special attention to localities and contains numerous illustrations that are attentive to the decorative arts and the material culture of early New York. <br> Surprising and enlightening, <em>Colonial New York</em> is a delight to read and provides new perspectives on our nation's beginnings.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Kammen</strong> is the Newton C.

It was perhaps the most cosmopolitan state in the world--and possibly the most volatile. <i>A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire</i> now gives scholars and general readers a concise history of the late empire between 1789 and 1918, turbulent years marked by incredible social change.</p><br><p> Moving past standard treatments of the subject, M. S�kr� Hanioglu emphasizes broad historical trends and processes more than single events. He examines the imperial struggle to centralize amid powerful opposition from local rulers, nationalist and other groups, and foreign powers. He looks closely at the socioeconomic changes this struggle wrought and addresses the Ottoman response to the challenges of modernity. Hanioglu shows how this history is not only essential to comprehending modern Turkey, but is integral to the histories of Europe and the world. He brings Ottoman society marvelously to life in all its facets--cultural, diplomatic, intellectual, literary, military, and political--and he mines imperial archives and other documents from the period to describe it as it actually was, not as it has been portrayed in postimperial nationalist narratives. <i>A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire</i> is a must-read for anyone seeking to understand the legacy left in this empire's ruins--a legacy the world still grapples with today.</p></p><p><p>"Without doubt the best history of the development of political ideas in the late Ottoman Empire.

Alba came to represent for contemporaries as well as for future generations the unacceptable face of Spanish imperialism.<br><br> In this intriguing re-evaluation, Henry Kamen narrates the duke&#x2019;s personal history, looking beyond the conventional image to reveal motives and to explain rather than simply to condemn. Kamen examines the early years of Alba&#x2019;s life, his travels over the whole of Europe, and the complex military and political career that made him Spain&#x2019;s leading general of the imperial age. Drawing on the duke&#x2019;s rich and expressive surviving correspondence, Kamen explores Alba&#x2019;s beliefs and considers his infamous actions within the contexts of his time and of the monarchs&#x2014;Emperor Charles V and King Philip II of Spain&#x2014;whom he served.</p></p><p><p><b>Henry Kamen</b>, an eminent authority on Spanish history, has published numerous books in the field, including <i>Empire: How Spain Became a World Power, 1492&#x2013;1763</i>.</p>". . . renders a pithy, vivid portrait of the Castilian grandee as reactionary, cultivated, authoritarian, and . . . loyal to kin and king." -- <i>Francis X.

Experienced teachers can use the comprehensive assessment resources to fortify the skills of a student while addressing any reading deficiencies present. Flexible strategies provide guidance for those working with any number of students. The authors provide twenty-four assessment appendices which house every classroom assessment tool needed to effectively monitor literacy progress.</p><p>One of the most popular volumes in reading education...a practical, &#34;how to&#34; book that provides future elementary reading teachers with concrete, straightforward methods for identifying and correcting 28 common reading errors.<p> The eighth edition of this book, like previous editions, is organized to provide reading specialists, teachers, tutors, and reading education students with specific, concrete methods for locating and correcting reading difficulties. It can be used in classroom or remedial situations and is designed so that busy practitioners can find in one place the essential information they need to help struggling readers overcome their literacy difficulties. Direct instruction, motivational learning activities, and abundant practice in the act of reading are stressed. As in the previous editions, instruction in individual reading skills is recommended where appropriate; however, emphasis is also placed on the use of strategic approaches to the teaching of reading. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZING TO ASSIST STRUGGLING READERS</b></p> <p> This book is composed of 29 chapters, divided into six major parts, which cover the full range of reading and reading-related skills. While the major features of the previous edition have been retained, this new edition has been updated and reorganized to make the information within more accessible to the reader. </p> <p> <b>Methods and Approaches.</b> The first section of this book is an introductory chapter that provides information on important principles of effective instruction for students who have reading difficulties. It is hoped that these principles will guide your reading throughout the remainder of the book. This chapter also presents useful techniques or approaches for teaching students with reading difficulties. These techniques/approaches are included in this chapter because they apply to many of the specific reading problems that are the focus of subsequent chapters. The first approach describes a number of oral reading techniques that have been shown to be unusually effective in helping students as they struggle to master decoding skills. Equally important, these techniques are among the most powerful teachers can use to develop students' reading fluency and build a foundation for better reading comprehension. A second method is the language-experience approach, which benefits both beginning and remedial readers. In this section, you will find a thorough description of these approaches and many practical activities for application in the classroom or tutorial setting. </p> <p> As with previous editions, the Reading Diagnosis Chart (see page xiii) matches the logical development of various reading skills and corresponds to the order of the chapters. The basic format of each chapter is the same. A section titled "Recognized By" defines and/or describes the reading difficulty. The "Discussion" section provides additional background information and explains how to test or otherwise determine if a student is experiencing difficulty in this area. The "Recommendations" section offers an alphabetical listing of specific strategies or activities you may use to help the student overcome the problem. In most chapters, these suggestions are followed by a variety of "Games and Exercises" that may be used to provide students with independent practice. </p> <p> <b>Emergent Literacy.</b> Part 2 addresses emergent literacy skills. In this edition, Chapter 1 is now devoted entirely to phonemic awareness, reflecting recent research affirming the importance of this area in early reading development. Alphabet knowledge is now addressed separately in Chapter 2. Tests for phonemic awareness (in Appendix B-4) assess rhyming ability, initial sound recognition, phoneme blending, and phoneme segmentation. Specific instructional procedures added to Chapter 1 are matched to each of the skills tested. </p> <p> <b>Decoding Skills.</b> In previous editions, Part 3 consisted of chapters focusing on a variety of different oral reading problems. In nearly every case, these problems are caused by some weakness in the reader's decoding skills. For this reason, decoding skills are now presented <i>before</i> oral reading difficulties. In these chapters you will learn how to assess and teach various decoding skills such as sight vocabulary, phonics, structural analysis, and the use of context clues. </p> <p> <b>Oral Reading, Comprehension, and Study Skills.</b> Part 4 consists of 10 chapters on specific oral reading difficulties such as poor pronunciation, omissions, repetitions, and so on. Part 5 addresses comprehension skills. Part 6 addresses instruction in study skills and other skills essential to success in school. </p> <p><b>THE APPENDICES: TOOLS FOR LOCATING AND CORRECTING READING DIFFICULTIES</b></p> <p> We encourage readers to use the materials provided in the appendices for <i>locating</i> reading difficulties to construct their own diagnostic kits. These appendices include a code for marking in oral diagnosis and, as previously noted, a new set of tests for phonemic awareness. The appendices also include materials and directions for assessing students' knowledge of the alphabet, basic sight words and phrases, phonics, structural analysis, contractions, the use of context clues, and two reading interest surveys. A new test for assessing the reading interests of older students and adults has been added to this edition. Altogether, more than 30 different diagnostic tests are provided in these appendices. Specific directions and important points to remember are provided for administering each test or survey instrument. </p> <p> Thirteen appendices have been provided for <i>correcting</i> reading difficulties. The first, a new appendix titled "Books for Emergent Readers," consists of lists of rhyming books, books with alliteration, and alphabet books. You will also find appendices for basic sight word sentences, a phonics primer, and newly revised phonogram lists, including sentences and other new features in this popular phonics instructional program. Next is an appendix titled "Words for Teaching Short and Long Vowels," followed by "Words, Sentences, and Stories for Teaching Structural Analysis." The remaining appendices address prepositional phrases, prefixes and suffixes, the cloze procedure, a chart for graphing students' progress in using the technique of repeated readings, a description of and charts for graphing students' progress in using the precision reading technique, charts for graphing words per minute and comprehension, and suggestions for interviewing parents of disabled readers. </p> <p> Finally, definitions of terms appear in a glossary at the end of the book. </p></p><h2>Public Choice III</h2><p>This book represents a considerable revision and expansion of Public Choice II (1989). As in the previous editions, all of the major topics of public choice are covered. These include: why the state exists, voting rules, federalism, the theory of clubs, two-party and multiparty electoral systems, rent seeking, bureaucracy, interest groups, dictatorship, the size of government, voter participation, and political business cycles. Normative issues in public choice are also examined. The book is suitable for upper level courses in economics dealing with politics, and political science courses emphasizing rational actor models.</p><p>Dennis C. Mueller is professor emeritus of economics at the University of Vienna. His main research interests are public choice, industrial economics, and constitutional political economy.

Grant and Robert E. Lee first met in battle. The Wilderness campaign of May 5-6 initiated an epic confrontation between these two Civil War commanders--one that would finally end, eleven months later, with Lee's surrender at Appomattox. <br><br>The eight essays here assembled explore aspects of the background, conduct, and repercussions of the fighting in the Wilderness. Through an often-revisionist lens, contributors to this volume focus on topics such as civilian expectations for the campaign, morale in the two armies, and the generalship of Lee, Grant, Philip H. Sheridan, Richard S. Ewell, A. P. Hill, James Longstreet, and Lewis A. Grant. Taken together, these essays revise and enhance existing work on the battle, highlighting ways in which the military and nonmilitary spheres of war intersected in the Wilderness. <br><br>The contributors: <br>--Peter S.

For much of the post-war period, the Nazi era has been viewed moralistically as an exceptional period of history intrinsically different from all others. Since the turn of the millennium, however, this view has been challenged by a powerful wave of normalization. Gavriel D. Rosenfeld charts this important international trend by examining the shifting representation of the Nazi past in contemporary western intellectual and cultural life. Focusing on works of historical scholarship, popular novels, counterfactual histories, feature films, and Internet websites, he identifies notable changes in the depiction of the Second World War, the Holocaust, and the figure of Adolf Hitler himself. By exploring the origins of these works and assessing the controversies they have sparked in the United States and Europe, Hi Hitler! offers a fascinating and timely analysis of the shifting status of the Nazi past in western memory.</p><p>In recent years, traditional moralistic views of the Nazi past in western intellectual and cultural life have been challenged by a powerful wave of normalization. Hi Hitler! examines how the exceptionality of the Nazi legacy has been progressively diminished by a sustained effort to relativize, universalize, and aestheticize it.Gavriel D. Rosenfeld is Professor of History at Fairfield University, Connecticut. His area of specialization is the history and memory of the Nazi era. He is the author of several books, including Building after Auschwitz: Jewish Architecture and the Memory of the Holocaust (2011), which was a finalist for the National Jewish Book Award in the category of visual arts; The World Hitler Never Made: Alternate History and the Memory of Nazism (Cambridge, 2005); Munich and Memory: Architecture, Monuments and the Legacy of the Third Reich (2000), and the co-edited work, Beyond Berlin: Twelve German Cities Confront the Nazi Past (2008). He is also the editor of the forthcoming volume of Jewish alternate histories, &#39;If Only We Had Died in Egypt!&#39; What Ifs of Jewish History from Abraham to Zionism, also to be published by Cambridge University Press. Rosenfeld is a frequent contributor to the Forward newspaper and edits the blog, The Counterfactual History Review.</p><h2>The United States and the International Criminal Court: National Security and International Law</h2><p>American reluctance to join the International Criminal Court illuminates important trends in international security and a central dilemma facing U.S. Foreign policy in the 21st century. The I.C.C. will prosecute individuals who commit egregious international human rights violations such as genocide. The Court is a logical culmination of the global trends toward expanding human rights and creating international institutions. The U.S., which fostered these trends because they served American national interests, initially championed the creation of an I.C.C. The Court fundamentally represents the triumph of American values in the international arena.Yet the United States now opposes the I.C.C. for fear of constraints upon America&#39;s ability to use force to protect its national interests. The principal national security and constitutional objections to the Court, which the volume explores in detail, inflate the potential risks inherent in joining the I.C.C. . More fundamentally, they reflect a belief in American exceptionalism that is unsustainable in today&#39;s world. Court opponents also underestimate the growing salience of international norms and institutions in addressing emerging threats to U.S. national interests. The misguided assessments that buttress opposition to the I.C.C. threaten to undermine American leadership and security in the 21st century more gravely than could any international institution.</p><p><b>Sarah B.

Coetzee treats the nature of the African landscape, its portrayal by non-African travelers and settlers, and its relation to European romanticism, landscape painting, and writing; the farm novel; various representations of Afrikaans and African languages in other tongues; and the racial symbolism and ideology of blood. In all cases, Coetzee's interest is in the nature and dynamics of colonial (and racist) literature.

In this narrative, the nineteenth century's absence is conspicuous--few have considered that era seriously, much less written books on it. But as Jenny Martinez shows in this novel interpretation of the roots of human rights law, the foundation of the movement that we know today was a product of one of the nineteenth century's central moral causes: the movement to ban the international slave trade. Originating in England in the late eighteenth century, abolitionism achieved remarkable success over the course of the nineteenth century. Martinez focuses in particular on the international admiralty courts, which tried the crews of captured slave ships. The courts, which were based in the Caribbean, West Africa, Cape Town, and Brazil, helped free at least 80,000 Africans from captured slavers between 1807 and 1871. Here then, buried in the dusty archives of admiralty courts, ships' logs, and the British foreign office, are the foundations of contemporary human rights law: international courts targeting states and non-state transnational actors while working on behalf the world's most persecuted peoples--captured West Africans bound for the slave plantations of the Americas. Fueled by a powerful thesis and novel evidence, Martinez's work will reshape the fields of human rights history and international human rights law.<br></p><p><b>Advance Praise for <i>The Slave Trade and the Origins of International Human Rights Law</i></b>"Scholars and citizens alike should be sure to read Jenny Martinez's compelling and memorable account of the roots of human rights law in struggles over the slave trade. &nbsp;Reaching across Africa, the European colonial nations, and North and South America, Professor Martinez recovers a truly global accomplishment and demonstrates the roots of contemporary international human rights courts were no recent invention and instead vital demonstrations of the power of states and nongovernmental actors in advancing human security and dignity." -- Martha Minow, Author of&nbsp;<i>Between Vengeance and Forgiveness</i>&nbsp;and Dean of Harvard Law School&nbsp;&nbsp;"A fascinating and highly educational account of attempts in the 1800s to end slavery and to free slaves found illegally on ships crossing the high seas. &nbsp;It often reads more like a good mystery novel than a scholarly work and is impossible to put down." -- Kelly Dawn Askin, Senior Legal Officer, International Justice, Open Society Justice Initiative&nbsp;&nbsp;"We sail alongside the myriad frauds adopted by slave traders to evade detection by the British Navy. &nbsp;We watch as villainous captains put on and slip off an array of national flags to navigate the hidden shoals of the salve treaties. &nbsp;With Martinez at the helm, the promise and the challenges of changing the world through international law come into view." -- John Fabian Witt, Allen H. Duffy Class of 1960 Professor Law and Professor of History, Yale Law School&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not only a fascinating account of a secret pocket of history but also a thought-provoking analysis of the powerful interplay of international morality, national might and individual human persistence in furtherance of a just cause. &nbsp;Martinez's study is meticulously researched, sprightly written, and not to be missed by those who prefer to remember the past rather than to repeat it." -- Patricia M.

As they explore this otherworldly place, the protagonists struggle to unlock the fabulous secret at its heart. A fantasy classic, <i>The Land That Time Forgot</i> remains a fast-paced adventure impossible to put down. Originally published in three installments in <i>Blue Book</i> magazine, Burroughs&#x2019;s trilogy is presented here in its entirety.</p><p>Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigiously productive writer of pulp fictions--literary entertainments, that is, published in inexpensive, easily obtained periodicals. His style was simple and instantly accessible, his stories riveting if often implausible tales of adventure, and of good overcoming evil. Burroughs wasn't much of an artist. But, as Mike Resnick writes in his introduction to this commemorative edition of Burroughs's immensely popular trilogy <i>The Land That Time Forgot</i>, first published in 1924, almost every book Burroughs wrote remains in print, and countless readers turn to his Mars and Tarzan novels every day.<p> In <i>Land</i>, Burroughs concocts a fabulous microworld, located somewhere in the South Pacific, called Caspak. On this mountainous island live winged, humanlike creatures, dinosaurs, ferocious beasts of prey, Neanderthals, "wild ape-men," and monstrous reptiles; they terrorize each other, to say nothing of the mixed crew of World War I-era adventurers who inadvertently land on a Caspakian beach and fight their way across the island, dining on Plesiosaurus steaks and having a grand old time in the company of a jungle princess. The story streaks onward like a bullet toward its surprise ending, and it's pure fun all the way. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>This book is a large print version using a minimum of 16 point type in a 6 by 9 inch size and perfect bound - a paperback.

The fifth edition now includes applications for engineering, sociology, psychology, etc., as well as traditional business applications. The authors use material from news articles, magazines, professional journals, and actual consulting problems to illustrate real business problems and how to solve them by using the tools of regression analysis.<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p> <p> This text is designed for two types of statistics courses. The early chapters, combined with a selection of the case study chapters, are designed for use in the second half of a two-semester (or two-quarter) introductory statistics sequence for undergraduates with statistics or non-statistics majors. Or, the text can be used for a course in applied regression analysis for masters or Ph.D. students in other fields. </p> <p> At first glance, these two uses for the text may seem inconsistent. How could a text be appropriate for both undergraduate and graduate students? The answer lies in the content. In contrast to a course in statistical theory, the level of mathematical knowledge required for an applied regression analysis course is minimal. Consequently, the difficulty encountered in learning the mechanics is much the same for both undergraduate and graduate students. The challenge is in the application-diagnosing practical problems, deciding on the appropriate linear model for a given situation, and knowing which inferential technique will answer the researcher's practical question. This takes experience, and it explains why a student with a non-statistics major can take an undergraduate course in applied regression analysis and still benefit from covering the same ground in a graduate course. </p> <p><b><i>Introductory Statistics Course</i></b></p> <p> It is difficult to identify the amount of material that should be included in the second semester of a two-semester sequence in introductory statistics. Optionally, a few lectures should be devoted to Chapter 1 (A Review of Basic Concepts) to make certain that all students possess a common background knowledge of the basic concepts covered in a first-semester (first-quarter) course. Chapter 2 (Introduction to Regression Analysis), Chapter 3 (Simple Linear Regression), Chapter 4 (Multiple Regression Models), Chapter 5 (Model Building), Chapter 6 (Variable Screening Methods), Chapter 7 (Some Regression Pitfalls), and Chapter 8 (Residual Analysis) provide the core for an applied regression analysis course. These chapters could be supplemented by the addition of Chapter 10 (Introduction to Time Series Modeling and Forecasting), Chapter 11 (Principles of Experimental Design), or Chapter 12 (The Analysis of Variance for Designed Experiments). </p> <p><b><i>Applied Regression for Graduates</i></b></p> <p> In our opinion, the quality of an applied graduate course is not measured by the number of topics covered or the amount of material memorized by the students. The measure is how well they can apply the techniques covered in the course to the solution of real problems encountered in their field of study. Consequently, we advocate moving on to new topics only after the students have demonstrate ability (through testing) to apply the techniques under discussion. In-class consulting sessions, where a case study is presented and the students have the opportunity to diagnose the problem and recommend an appropriate method of analysis, are very helpful in teaching applied regression analysis. This approach is particularly useful in helping students master the difficult topic of model selection and model building (Chapters 4-8) and relating questions about the model to real-world questions. The case study chapters (Chapters 13-17) illustrate the type of material that might be useful for this purpose. </p> <p> A course in applied regression analysis for graduate students would start in the same manner as the undergraduate course, but would move more rapidly over the review material and would more than likely be supplemented by Appendix A (The Mechanics of a Multiple Regression Analysis), one of the statistical software Windows tutorials in Appendices D, E, or F (SAS, SPSS, or MINITAB), Chapter 9 (Special Topics in Regression), and other chapters selected by the instructor. in the undergraduate course, we recommend the use of case studies and in-class consulting sessions to help students develop an ability to formulate appropriate statistical models and to interpret the results of their analyses. </p> <p><b>FEATURES</b></p> <ol> <li><b>Readability.</b> We have purposely tried to make this a teaching (rather than a reference) text. Concepts are explained in a logical intuitive manner using worked examples.</li> <li><b>Emphasis on model building.</b> The formulation of an appropriate statistical model is fundamental to any regression analysis. This topic is treated Chapters 4-8 and is emphasized throughout the text.</li> <li><b>Emphasis on developing regression skills.</b> In addition to teaching the basic concepts and methodology of regression analysis, this text stresses its use, as tool, in solving applied problems. Consequently, a major objective of the text is to develop a skill in applying regression analysis to appropriate real-life situations.</li> <li><b>Numerous real data-based examples and exercises.</b> The text contains many worked examples that illustrate important aspects of model construction, data analysis, and the interpretation of results. Nearly every exercise is based on data and a problem extracted from a news article, magazine, or journal. Exercises are located at the ends of key sections and at the ends of chapters.</li> <li><b>Case study chapters.</b> The text contains five case study chapters, each of which addresses a real-life research problem. The student can see how regression analysis was used to answer the practical questions posed by the problem, proceeding with the formulation of appropriate statistical models to the analysis and interpretation of sample data.</li> <li><b>Data sets.</b> The text contains four complete data sets that are associated with the case studies (Chapters 13-17). These can be used by instructors and students to practice model-building and data analyses.</li> <li><b>Extensive use of statistical software.</b> Tutorials on how to use any of three popular statistical software packages, SAS, SPSS, and MINITAB, are provided in Appendices D, E, and F, respectively. The printouts of the respective software packages are presented and discussed throughout the text.</li> </ol> <p><b>NEW TO THE SIXTH EDITION</b></p> <p> Although the scope and coverage remain the same, the sixth edition contains several substantial changes, additions, and enhancements: </p> <ol> <li><b>More computer printouts.</b> A SAS, SPSS, or MINITAB printout now accompanies every statistical technique presented, allowing the instructor to emphasize interpretations of the statistical results rather than the calculations required to obtain the results.</li> <li><b>Statistical software tutorials.</b> The Appendix now includes basic instructions on how to use the Windows versions of SAS, SPSS, and MINITAB. Step-by-step instructions and screen shots for each method presented in the text are shown.</li> <li><b>Describing qualitative data.</b> Anew section (Sec. 1.3) on graphical and numerical methods of describing qualitative data has been added to Chapter 1.</li> <li><b>Paired comparisons for means.</b> New material on comparing two population means using a paired difference experiment is now included in Chapter 1 (Sec. 1.10).</li> <li><b>Reorganization of multiple regression models.</b> The multiple regression models presented in Chapter 4 have been reorganized according to order and complexity. First-order models are presented first, followed by interaction and second-order models.</li> <li><b>Model validation.</b> The section on external model validation (previously presented as a special topic in Chapter 9) has been moved to the model building chapter (Chapter 5). Several new examples are presented.</li> <li><b>Variable screening methods.</b> Stepwise regression and the all-possible-regressions-selection procedure are now included in a separate chapter (Chapter 6).</li> <li><b>Spline regression.</b> Spline regression methods are now discussed in the section on robust regression (Sec. 9.8) in Chapter 9: Special Topics.</li> <li><b>Case study 13: Residential property sale price data updated.</b> The data set for the case study on predicting sale prices of residential properties has been updated to reflect current economic trends.</li> </ol> <p> Numerous less obvious changes in details have been made throughout the text in response to suggestions by current users of the earlier editions. </p> <p><b>SUPPLEMENTS</b></p> <p> The text is also accompanied by the following supplementary material: </p> <ol> <li><b>Student's solutions manual.</b> (by Mark Dummeldinger). A student's exercise solutions manual presents the full solutions to the odd exercises contained in the text.</li> <li><b>Instructor's solutions manual.</b> (by Mark Dummeldinger). The instructor's exercise solutions manual presents the full solutions to the other half (the even) exercises contained in the text. For adopters, the manual is complimentary from the publisher.</li> <li><b>Data CD.</b> The text is accompanied by a CD that contains files for all data sets marked with a CD icon in the text. These include data sets for text examples, exercises, and case studies. The data files are saved in ASCII format for easy importing into statistical software (SAS, SPSS, and MINITAB).</li> </ol></p><h2>A World of Weather: Fundamentals of Meteorology</h2><p><p><strong>6th Edition Now Available!</strong></p><p>A current, thorough, conversational, and scientifically sound resource on meteorology.</p><p><strong><em>A World of Weather: Fundamentals of Meteorology</em></strong> presents basic principles that enable students to gain a &#x201c;thorough possession&#x201d; of the underlying scientific principles of meteorology and to be able to think critically about them.

Since that time, the work has established a powerful hold on the western popular imagination, and is now considered a classic of spiritual literature. Over the years, <em>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</em> has inspired numerous commentaries, an illustrated edition, a play, a video series, and even an opera. Translators, scholars, and popular devotees of the book have claimed to explain its esoteric ideas and reveal its hidden meaning. Few, however, have uttered a word about its history. Bryan J. Cuevas seeks to fill this gap in our knowledge by offering the first comprehensive historical study of the <em>Great Liberation upon Hearing in the Bardo</em>, and by grounding it firmly in the context of Tibetan history and culture. He begins by discussing the many ways the texts have been understood (and misunderstood) by westerners, beginning with its first editor, the Oxford-educated anthropologist Walter Y. Evans-Wentz, and continuing through the present day. The remarkable fame of the book in the west, Cuevas argues, is strikingly disproportionate to how the original Tibetan texts were perceived in their own country. Cuevas tells the story of how <em>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</em> was compiled in Tibet, of the lives of those who preserved and transmitted it, and explores the history of the rituals through which the life of the dead is imagined in Tibetan society. This book provides not only a fascinating look at a popular and enduring spiritual work, but also a much-needed corrective to the proliferation of ahistorical scholarship surrounding <em>The Tibetan Book of the</em> <em>Dead</em>.<br></p><p><br><b>Bryan J. Cuevas</b> is John F. Priest Professor of Religion and Director of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies at Florida State University."Cuevas' achievement lies in his association of a time, place, and likely author(s) with the earliest works, a major step forward in our understanding of this genre. The presentation of the sophisticated religious milieu of the text's 'revealers' is lucid, grounded as it is in a strong command of the literature. Historical developments relating to hagiography, textual transmission, funeral liturgy, and other matters are treated with similar ease...In many ways, this constitutes a model contribution to Tibetan studies." --&nbsp;<i>Religious Studies Review</i><br>&nbsp;<br>" ...deserves to be highly recommended as a precious contribution to the field of the fascinating <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>" --&nbsp;<i>Journal of Asian Studies</i><br><br>"Cuevas's book is required reading for anyone seriously interested in the <i>Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>." --&nbsp;<i>Choice</i><br><br>"<i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is without doubt the Tibetan work best known in the West and in the three-quarters of a century since its initial translation it has won a secure place for itself in the Religious Studies canon. Nevertheless, its actual history and role in Tibetan religious culture have remained topics of ignorance, even among scholars of Buddhism. In <i>The Hidden History of the Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, Bryan Cuevas now masterfully addresses these matters, shedding welcome light on a celebrated book and on Tibetan religious history more generally." -- Matthew Kapstein, Professor, The University of Chicago,Director of Tibetan Studies, Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, Paris<br><br>"Works that are considered to be timeless world classics arose at specific times and in specific places. <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i> is one such work, and it is through understanding its time and its place that we can gain new insights into many meanings.

But who was the man behind the legend? Was he truly a monster, or a capable ruler cursed by bad luck? In this new book bestselling historian Marc Morris draws on contemporary chronicles and the king's own letters to bring the real King John vividly to life.<br><br> John was dynamic, inventive and relentless, but also a figure with terrible flaws. In two interwoven stories, we see how he went from being a youngest son with limited prospects to the ruler of the greatest dominion in Europe, an empire that stretched from the Scottish border to the Pyrenees. His rise to power involved treachery, rebellion and murder. His reign saw oppression on an almost unprecedented scale: former friends hounded into exile and oblivion; Wales, Scotland and Ireland invaded; the greatest level of financial exploitation since the Norman Conquest. A quarrel with the pope led to the king being excommunicated and England being placed under Interdict. John's tyrannical rule climaxed in conspiracy and revolt, and his leading subjects famously forced him to issue Magna Carta, a document binding him and his successors to behave better in future. The king's rejection of the charter led to civil war and foreign invasion, bringing his life to a disastrous close.<br><br> Authoritative and dramatic, Marc Morris's <em>King John</em> offers a compelling portrait of an extraordinary man, whose reign marked a momentous turning point in the history of Britain and Europe. 16 pages of color and B&amp;W illustrations</p><p>Marc Morris is a historian and broadcaster specializing in the Middle Ages.

In the meantime there has been something of a revolution in the way we view classical drama generally and Euripides in particular. "The Plays of Euripides" reflects that revolution and aims to show how Euripides was continually reinventing himself. A truly Protean figure, he seems to set out on a new journey in each of his surviving nineteen plays. Between general introduction and final summary, Morwood's chapters identify the themes that underlie the plays and concentrate, above all, on demonstrating the extraordinary diversity of this great dramatist.</p></p><p><p>James Morwood is Grocyn Lecturer in Classics, Oxford University, and Dean of Wadham College; he was formerly head of Classics at Harrow School. His numerous publications include translations of eleven of Euripides' plays in the Oxford World Classics Series (1997, 1999, 2001).

They also consider the continuity of James&#39;s moral, social and philosophical preoccupations through the various periods of his creative life. The author demands no intimate knowledge of the works: she begins each study with an account of the story which is itself an important part of the elucidation, and then proceeds to unfold layer after layer of meaning. The author&#39;s arguments are intellectually stimulating and her interpretations sensitive and accompanied by ample and carefully chosen quotations, which allow James&#39;s voice to be heard whenever necessary.</p><p>This 1962 appraisal of seven of James&#39;s major works provides an insight into his artistic purpose and a fuller appreciation of his material and method.

At the turn of the 20th century, Thompson's entrepreneurial drive made him into an entertainment mogul who helped to define the popular culture of his day.<br>In this lively biography, Woody Register tells Thompson's remarkable story and examines the transformation of commerce and entertainment as American society moved into an era of mass marketing and large-scale corporate enterprise. Getting his start as a promoter of carnival shows at world's fairs, Thompson was one of the principal developers of Coney Island, where he created the majestic Luna Park. Register traces Thompson's career as he built the mammoth Hippodrome Theater in Manhattan, where he mounted many productions noted for their spectacular--and spectacularly costly--staging effects. Register shows how Thompson's fantasies appealed to the growing legions of Americans who found themselves in a world that seemed increasingly "businesslike" and profit oriented. He illustrates how Thompson aggressively marketed to adult consumers a world of make-believe and childlike play, carefully crafting his own public image as "the boy who never grew up."<br>Colorful, well-written, and insightful, <em>The Kid of Coney Island</em> brings to life a kaleidoscopic era in New York history as well as one of its most striking characters.<br></p><p>Fred Thompson (1873-1919) was a pioneering entrepreneur who encouraged Americans, especially American men, to have fun and stop feeling guilty about it. He designed and built Luna Park, which in 1903 transformed Coney Island from an area so tawdry it was known as "Sodom by the Sea" into a respectable venue for middle-class recreation. He created the Hippodrome, the world's largest theater when it opened in 1905, and filled it with lavish spectacles at affordable ticket prices. He moved on to become "the boy-wonder of Broadway producers," responsible for such popular hits as <i>Brewster's Millions</i> and <i>Little Nemo</i>. His financial acumen never equaled his showmanship (he lost control of both Luna Park and the Hippodrome to better businessmen), but he seems to have thoroughly enjoyed spending vast sums of money to make fantasy and luxury accessible to the masses. Woody Register, professor of American Studies at Sewanee, explores Thompson's life and career as a paradigm for the sea change in commercial culture that took place in the early years of the 20th century, when the Victorian emphasis on educational, elevating entertainment was challenged by a more hedonistic attitude that valued pleasure for its own sake. Gender theory and other currently trendy academic disciplines inform the author's point of view without detracting unduly from his well-written and well-paced narrative. Register could have eased up on the Peter Pan metaphors, but he convincingly links Thompson to present-day innovators who've made a bundle by refusing to grow up, such as director Steven Spielberg and the whiz kids who created the personal computer and Internet revolutions. This is a nice example of a scholarly work that reaches beyond its core audience to appeal to the general public. <i>--Wendy Smith</i><br><strong>Woody Register</strong> is Professor of American Studies at Sewanee, The University of the South.

Widowed at 26, Sevigne spent most of her time in Paris, where she became a popular member of the salons and the court, considered as a especially witty conversationalist. In early 1671, Francoise and her infant daughter left for Provence, and the letters that would make up the largest bulk of Sevigne's correspondence (68% of her extant letters) began. Francoise Sevigne wrote to her daughter whenever they were apart---at least weekly, sometimes more frequently---giving her court news (valuable to the Grignans, far from the center of power), Parisian gossip, advice (usually unwanted), and always expressions of her love.</p><h2>The God Who Speaks: Learning the Language of God</h2><p>As Christians we believe that God speaks - that God has spoken to people down through the centuries and still speaks to us today. But just how does God speak to us? Has his speech changed over time? And how do we &#34;hear&#34; the voice of God? In this insightful book Ben Campbell Johnson explores the subject of divine speech, highlighting its importance to faith and leading Christian believers into the practice of listening for God&#39;s voice in daily life. / Johnson first explores the biblical foundations of divine communication, tracing the ways that God has spoken to humankind from the calling of Abraham, to the appearance of Jesus, to the continuing work of the Spirit in the early church. He then gleans important lessons about God&#39;s language from a wide range of Christian figures throughout history - Polycarp, Julian of Norwich, Teresa of �vila, Henri Nouwen, and others. / As this historical record shows, God communicates with us in a variety of ways. In exploring these different modes of &#34;GodSpeech,&#34; Johnson deftly guides readers into the practice of &#34;intensive listening,&#34; a way of posing issues to God and discerning his response. Numerous anecdotes illuminate Johnson&#39;s discussion, and each chapter ends with questions for reflection and discussion as well as suggestions for journaling. Johnson concludes the book by recounting a number of personal experiences that vividly illustrate the value of learning to listen to God&#39;s voice. / At a time when many Christians hunger for a more personal, meaningful connection with God, this book shows readers how to discern divine language and forge a closer, richer relationship with &#34;the God who speaks.&#34;</p><p>Ben Campbell Johnson is professor emeritus of Christian spirituality at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia.</p><h2>Physics for Scientists and Engineers (Study Guide and Student Solutions Manual)</h2><p>Contains chapter objectives, summaries with additional examples, self-study quizzes, key mathematical equations, and complete worked-out solutions to every other odd problem in the text.</p><p></p><h2>An Introduction to Statistical Methods and Data Analysis</h2><p>Statistics is a thought process.

Since 2001, Congress has abolished the tax on inherited wealth and passed a major income tax cut every year, including two of the three largest income tax cuts in American history despite a long drawn-out war and massive budget deficits. <i>The Permanent Tax Revolt</i> traces the origins of this anti-tax campaign to the 1970s, in particular, to the influence of grassroots tax rebellions as homeowners across the United States rallied to protest their local property taxes. Isaac William Martin advances the provocative new argument that the property tax revolt was not a conservative backlash against big government, but instead a defensive movement for government protection from the market. The tax privilege that the tax rebels were defending was in fact one of the largest government social programs in the postwar era. While the movement to defend homeowners' tax breaks drew much of its inspiration&#x2015;and many of its early leaders&#x2015;from the progressive movement for welfare rights, politicians on both sides of the aisle quickly learned that supporting big tax cuts was good politics. In time, American political institutions and the strategic choices made by the protesters ultimately channeled the movement toward the kind of tax relief favored by the political right, with dramatic consequences for American politics today.</p><p>Isaac William Martin is Assistant Professor of Sociology at the University of California, San Diego."A very informative and stimulating read." (<i>Marginal Revolution</i>)<br><br>"Isaac William Martin offers an important and insightful addition to this research strand, presenting a powerful mix of social policy assessment, social movement analysis, political science, and economic sociology. ...Martin's book is recommended reading to all interested in the linkages between social policy, social movements, and taxation." (Rafael Marques <i><i>American Journal of Sociology</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>The Permanent Tax Revolt</i> tells a surprising story about the anti-tax movement that has dominated American politics for the past several decades. In a welcome break with market fundamentalism, this lively, well-written, and insightful book casts much-needed new light on debates about tax politics, the welfare state, and contemporary social movements."

A young woman is stabbed to death on her front stoop&#x2015;a murder the <em>New York Times</em> called &#x201c;a frozen moment of dramatic, disturbing social change.&#x201d; The victim, Catherine &#x201c;Kitty&#x201d; Genovese, became an urban martyr, butchered by a sociopathic killer in plain sight of thirty-eight neighbors who &#x201c;didn&#x2019;t want to get involved.&#x201d; Her sensational case provoked an anxious outcry and launched a sociological theory known as the &#x201c;Bystander Effect.&#x201d; <p>That&#x2019;s the narrative told by the <em>Times</em>, movies, TV programs, and countless psychology textbooks. But as award-winning author Kevin Cook reveals, the Genovese story is just that, a story. The truth is far more compelling&#x2015;and so is the victim.</p><p>Now, on the fiftieth anniversary of her murder, Cook presents the real Kitty Genovese. She was a vibrant young woman&#x2015;unbeknownst to most, a lesbian&#x2015;a bartender working (and dancing) her way through the colorful, fast-changing New York of the &#x2019;60s, a cultural kaleidoscope marred by the Kennedy assassination, the Cold War, and race riots. Downtown, Greenwich Village teemed with beatniks, folkies, and so-called misfits like Kitty and her lover. Kitty Genovese evokes the Village&#x2019;s gay and lesbian underground with deep feeling and colorful detail.</p><p>Cook also reconstructs the crime itself, tracing the movements of Genovese&#x2019;s killer, Winston Moseley, whose disturbing trial testimony made him a terrifying figure to police and citizens alike, especially after his escape from Attica State Prison.</p><p>Drawing on a trove of long-lost documents, plus new interviews with her lover and other key figures, Cook explores the enduring legacy of the case. His heartbreaking account of what really happened on the night Genovese died is the most accurate and chilling to date.</p> 16 pages of photographs</p><p>A former senior editor at Sports Illustrated, Kevin Cook is the author of Titanic Thompson, Tommy&#39;s Honor, Kitty Genovese and The Dad Report.

Britain, Salway writes, was a place of fascination for the Romans--a fascination he brings to life with beautiful maps and illustrations and a thorough, authoritative narrative.<br> Salway introduces us to what is known of the pre-Roman Britons, and deftly describes Julius Caesar's dramatic expeditions in 55 and 54 B.C; in the years that followed, new contacts grew between the Romans and the inhabitants of this strange island. Salway's comprehensive narrative blends together the changing politics and ways of life of the native Britons, the climactic conquest under Claudius and the subsequent, often violent consolidation, and the place of the new province in Imperial affairs. He carefully integrates the story of Roman Britain into the story of the Empire itself, showing the close attention the emperors paid to British affairs, and the interventions in imperial politics by the legions stationed there. Salway draws on the latest archeological finds, thoughtfully assessing the evidence and weaving it into his seamless narrative.<br> Highly authoritative and readable, <em>A History of Roman Britain</em> brings alive the classical past of a familiar part of today's world.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Peter Salway</strong>, formerly a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and subsequently of All Souls College, Oxford, is an Emeritus Professor of the Open University and Chairman of the Oxford Archaeological Unit.<br><br>"One could not ask for a nore meticulous or scholarly assessment of what Britain meant to the Romans, or Rome to Britons, than Peter Salway's monumental study."--<em>Sunday Times</em><p></p><br>"Superbly readable...splendid witness to the vivacity and accessibility of the latest work on this exciting period."--<em>Sunday Telegraph</em><p></p><br>"There will be new discoveries; but this is a book that will surely stand the test of time."--<em>Times Literary Supplement</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Optimality Theory (Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics)</h2><p>This is an introduction to Optimality Theory, whose central idea is that surface forms of language reflect resolutions of conflicts between competing constraints.

He is author of the forthcoming book <em>Nietszche's Pursuit of</em> <em>Modernism</em>, to be published by Routledge.In 17 often insightful essays, academics and social critics explore the connections between the Rodney King incidents--the beating, the trial and what the editor terms the subsequent "uprising"--and conditions in America's cities. Though some essays suffer from redundancy and overly academic language, others offer provocative observations. Houston A. Baker finds King's silence during his trial emblematic of the enforced silence of African Americans during the age of slavery. Arguing that the King verdict was not a unique failure of justice, Kimberle Crenshaw and Gary Peller suggest that lawyers for the Los Angeles police officers used the same tactic of decontextualizing evidence that the U.S. Supreme Court used in a decision weakening the claim of minority-owned businesses for "set-aside" government contracts. Describing the failure of police to protect Korean merchants, Sumi K. Cho observes how the Korean community, though stereotyped as a "a model minority," was sacrificed in the interests of white dominance.

As a child, watching the joy/solace/comfort/pure pleasure people took in singing songs, I wanted to write the words and music that became "their song."

Iliad: ISBN 9781480048348<br><br>"The thing that best distinguishes this from all other translations of Homer is that it alone equals the original in its ceaseless pour of verbal music. . . . Pope worked miracles in highlighting the play of vowels through his lines. . . . Every word is weighted, with a pressure of mind behind it. This is a poem you can live your way into, over the years, since it yields more at every encounter." -- "On Reading Pope's Homer" <i>New York Times</i>, 6/1/1997<br><br>When Alexander Pope's majestic translation of Homer's Odyssey appeared in 1726, his translation of the Iliad had already been acclaimed by Samuel Johnson as "a performance which no age or nation could hope to equal." For the Odyssey, Pope was aided by William Broome and Elijah Fenton. While other translations have since appeared, Pope's is unrivaled in its melodious beauty.Illustrated beautifully by Flaxman, this is the tale of Odysseus&#x2019;s return from the war at Troy, seeking Ithaca his home and Penelope his wife. Along the way he encounters the murderous Cyclops, the treacherous Circe, and the nymphs, gods, and goddesses who variously assist and impede his homeward journey. Many are his travails and dramatic his final homecoming wherein he joins battle with Penelope&#x2019;s erstwhile suitors. As with the Iliad, Pope, who had two collaborators on this project, renders Homer into a muscular and euphonious English poetry worthy of reading aloud.This is the Odyssey that has formed generations of British and American culture through a beauteous poetics that lends itself to easy recollection. With a clean and crisp text illustrated by the inimitable line drawings of Flaxman, this edition finally gives to audiences a fitting rendering of this monument of English verse which captures uniquely the song of Homer himself. <br><br>"For Homer to take his place among our classics it must be the case that a rendering could exercise the same spell over the collective ear as English-language poets. You could not memorize Fagles, or Lattimore - or Hobbes, a few phrases apart - while Pope, even at his least Homeric, is memorable. . . . Pope is not superseded." -- David Ricks, Kings College, London, <i>Classics Ireland</i>, vol. 4, 1997<br><br>Published by Ex Fontibus Company.</p><p>Alexander Pope (21 May 1688 ? 30 May 1744) was an 18th-century English poet, best known for his satirical verse and for his translation of Homer's Iliad (ISBN 9781480048348) and Odyssey (ISBN 9781490516424). Famous for his use of the heroic couplet, he is the third-most frequently quoted writer in The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, after Shakespeare and Tennyson. <br><br> Pope had been fascinated by Homer since childhood. In 1713, he announced his plans to publish a translation of the Iliad. The work would be available by subscription, with one volume appearing every year over the course of six years. Pope was 25 years old. He secured a revolutionary deal with the publisher Bernard Lintot, which brought him two hundred guineas (210) a volume, equivalent to about 26,000 as of 2012, a vast sum at the time. <br><br> Encouraged by the success of the Iliad, Pope translated the Odyssey. The translation appeared in 1726, but this time, confronted with the arduousness of the task, he enlisted the help of William Broome and Elijah Fenton. Pope attempted to conceal the extent of the collaboration (he himself translated only twelve books, Broome eight and Fenton four), but the secret leaked out. It did some damage to Pope's reputation for a time, but not to his profits. <br><br> By the mid-18th century new fashions in poetry emerged. A decade after Pope's death, Joseph Warton claimed that Pope's style of poetry was not the most excellent form of the art. The Romantic movement that rose to prominence in early 19th-century England was more ambivalent towards his work. Though Lord Byron identified Pope as one of his chief influences (believing his scathing satire of contemporary English literature English Bards and Scotch Reviewers to be a continuance of Pope's tradition), William Wordsworth found Pope's style fundamentally too decadent a representation of the human condition. <br><br> In the 20th century Pope's reputation was revived. Pope's work was found to be full of references to the people and places of his time, and these aided people's understanding of the past. The postwar period stressed the power of Pope's poetry, recognising that Pope's immersion in Christian and Biblical culture lent depth to his poetry. Maynard Mack thought highly of Pope's poetry, arguing that Pope's moral vision demanded as much respect as his technical excellence. In the years 1953?1967 the production of the definitive Twickenham edition of Pope's poems was published in ten volumes.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Sisters</h2><p>A lavish photographic gift book that spent more than a year on the New York Times bestseller list is a tribute to the unbreakable bonds of sisterhood and includes tales by such individuals as Coretta Scott King and Chris Evert.</p><p><b>Carol Saline</b> is an award-winning journalist, broadcaster, author of three books, and co-author of three photo-essay books.Since 1974, Carol Saline has worked as a senior writer at <i>Philadelphia Magazine</i>, where she specializes in health, profiles, and investigative reporting.

The afternoon was like spring, the air was soft and damp, and the buds of the willows had been beguiled into swelling a little, so that there was a bloom over them, and the grass looked as if it had been growing green of late instead of fading steadily. It seemed like a reprieve from the doom of winter, or from even November itself.<br><br>The dense and early darkness which usually follows such unseasonable mildness had already begun to cut short the pleasures of this springlike day, when a young woman, who carried a child in her arms, turned from a main road of Oldfields into a foot-path which led southward across the fields and pastures. She seemed sure of her way, and kept the path without difficulty, though a stranger might easily have lost it here and there, where it led among the patches of sweet-fern or bayberry bushes, or through shadowy tracts of small white-pines. She stopped sometimes to rest, and walked more and more wearily, with increasing effort; but she kept on her way desperately, as if it would not do to arrive much later at the place which she was seeking. The child seemed to be asleep; it looked too heavy for so slight a woman to carry.<br><br>The path led after a while to a more open country, there was a low hill to be climbed, and at its top the slender figure stopped and seemed to be panting for breath. A follower might have noticed that it bent its head over the child's for a moment as it stood, dark against the darkening sky. There had formerly been a defense against the Indians on this hill, which in the daytime commanded a fine view of the surrounding country, and the low earthworks or foundations of the garrison were still plainly to be seen. The woman seated herself on the sunken wall in spite of the dampness and increasing chill, still holding the child, and rocking to and fro like one in despair. The child waked and began to whine and cry a little in that strange, lonely place, and after a few minutes, perhaps to quiet it, they went on their way. Near the foot of the hill was a brook, swollen by the autumn rains; it made a loud noise in the quiet pastures, as if it were crying out against a wrong or some sad memory. The woman went toward it at first, following a slight ridge which was all that remained of a covered path which had led down from the garrison to the spring below at the brookside. If she had meant to quench her thirst here, she changed her mind, and suddenly turned to the right, following the brook a short distance, and then going straight toward the river itself and the high uplands, which by daylight were smooth pastures with here and there a tangled apple-tree or the grassy cellar of a long vanished farm-house.<br><br>It was night now; it was too late in the year for the chirp of any insects; the moving air, which could hardly be called wind, swept over in slow waves, and a few dry leaves rustled on an old hawthorn tree which grew beside the hollow where a house had been, and a low sound came from the river. The whole country side seemed asleep in the darkness, but the lonely woman felt no lack of companionship; it was well suited to her own mood that the world slept and said nothing to her,&#x2014;it seemed as if she were the only creature alive.<br><br>A little this side of the river shore there was an old burial place, a primitive spot enough, where the graves were only marked by rough stones, and the short, sheep-cropped grass was spread over departed generations of the farmers and their wives and children. By day it was in sight of the pine woods and the moving water, and nothing hid it from the great sky overhead, but now it was like a prison walled about by the barriers of night. However eagerly the woman had hurried to this place, and with what purpose she may have sought the river bank, when she recognized her surroundings she stopped for a moment, swaying and irresolute. "No, no!" sighed the child plaintively, and she shuddered, and started forward; then, as her feet stumbled among the graves, she turned and fled. It no longer seemed solitary, but as if a legion of ghosts which had been wandering under cover of the dark had discovered this intruder, and were chasing her and flocking around her and oppressing her from every side. And as she caught sight of a light in a far-away farmhouse window, a light which had been shining after her all the way down to the river, she tried to hurry toward it. The unnatural strength of terror urged her on; she retraced her steps like some pursued animal; she remembered, one after another, the fearful stories she had known of that ancient neighborhood; the child cried, but she could not answer it. She fell again and again, and at last all her strength seemed to fail her, her feet refused to carry her farther and she crept painfully, a few yards at a time, slowly along the ground. The fear of her superhuman enemies had forsaken her, and her only desire was to reach the light that shone from the looming shadow of the house.<br><br>At last she was close to it; at last she gave one great sigh, and the child fell from her grasp; at last she clutched the edge of the worn doorstep with both hands, and lay still.</p><h2>The Ingredients: A Guided Tour of the Elements</h2><p>In <em>The Ingredients</em>, Philip Ball blends history and science as he offers an illuminating look at our centuries-long struggle to understand the nature of the physical world.<br> It's been a long journey from the ancient belief in four elements--earth, water, fire, air--to the hundred plus elements that occupy the modern periodic table, and Ball makes a perfect tour guide, highlighting the many points of interest on the way. He introduces us to key scientists such as Lavoisier, who named oxygen, proved that water is not an element, demolished the ancient 4-elements theory, and lost his head to the guillotine. Ball highlights the unexpected opportunities for making useful things from the riches found on the periodic table. We learn, for instance, that the seemingly useless argon (after the Greek <em>argos</em>, 'lazy'--because it did nothing) makes perfect filler for light bulbs, because no matter how hot the bulb gets, argon won't react. Likewise, silicon, a very poor conductor of electricity (hence the label semiconductor) is perfect for computer chips, because the slow movement of electrons is easier to manipulate. Ball shows us how to read the periodic table and he recounts Mendeleyev's tale of discovering the correct form to the table "in a dream." He also explains the difficulties of defining and identifying the elements, the principles behind the formation of synthetic elements, and the ways in which particular elements (gold, iron, oxygen) shaped culture and technology. <br> From the alchemical quest for the Philosopher's Stone to the legend of the Midas touch, <em>The Ingredients</em> provides an engaging look at the elements that make up the world we live in.</p><p><br><strong>Philip Ball</strong> is a science writer and consultant editor for <em>Nature</em>. He is the author of <em>Self-Made Tapestry, Designing the Molecular World, Stories of the Invisible: A Guided Tour of Molecules</em>, and <em>Life's Matrix: A Biography of Water</em>. He lives in London.<br><br>"Ball brings the periodic table to life."--<em>Discover Magazine</em><p></p><br>"These ingredients combine to make a tasty little book."--<em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"Provocative...surely worth a read by both general readers and chemists."--<em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"A delight of a book with a modest title that gives small hint of its merits. Elegantly written, it is about the long search to find out what the Earth and the life it supports are made of, a fascinating tale. <em>The Ingredients</em> could have been a plodding expedition following the tracks of Dmitry Mendeleyev and his periodic table, informative but eyelid-weighing. Instead it's far-reaching, entertaining and salted with anedote, such as the story of the ingenious way that gold was concealed from the Nazis in Denmark by dissolving it in acid and keeping jars containing the black solution in full view on a laboratory shelf. It could become a classic."--<em>New Scientist</em><p></p><br>"By weaving the elements seamlessly into a coherent narrative, the author has given meaning to the entire system without overwhelming the reader with the profusion of its part. That's good writing."--<em>Natural History</em><p></p><br>"Ball covers the history of his field with admirable conciseness, taking welcome detours into the colorful lore of certain members of the periodic table, notably gold, which perhaps event today remains the single most charismatic of earthly substances. Solid scientific history, entertainingly presented."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Songs of Experience: Modern American and European Variations on a Universal Theme</h2><p>Few words in both everyday parlance and theoretical discourse have been as rhapsodically defended or as fervently resisted as "experience." Yet, to date, there have been no comprehensive studies of how the concept of experience has evolved over time and why so many thinkers in so many different traditions have been compelled to understand it. <i>Songs of Experience </i>is a remarkable history of Western ideas about the nature of human experience written by one of our best-known intellectual historians. With its sweeping historical reach and lucid comparative analysis&#x2015;qualities that have made Martin Jay's previous books so distinctive and so successful&#x2015;<i>Songs of Experience </i>explores Western discourse from the sixteenth century to the present, asking why the concept of experience has been such a magnet for controversy. Resisting any single overarching narrative, Jay discovers themes and patterns that transcend individuals and particular schools of thought and illuminate the entire spectrum of intellectual history. <br><br>As he explores the manifold contexts for understanding experience&#x2015;epistemological, religious, aesthetic, political, and historical&#x2015;Jay engages an exceptionally broad range of European and American traditions and thinkers from the American pragmatists and British Marxist humanists to the Frankfurt School and the French poststructuralists, and he delves into the thought of individual philosophers as well, including Montaigne, Bacon, Locke, Hume and Kant, Oakeshott, Collingwood, and Ankersmit. Provocative, engaging, erudite, this key work will be an essential source for anyone who joins the ongoing debate about the material, linguistic, cultural, and theoretical meaning of "experience" in modern cultures.</p><p>"Martin Jay is one of the most influential intellectual historians in contemporary America, and here he shows once again a willingness to tackle the 'big issues' in the Western cultural tradition.... A remarkable history of ideas about the nature of human experience."&#x2015;Lloyd Kramer, author of <i>Threshold of a New World </i><br><br>"A magisterial study of one of the most elusive, contested, and pervasively important concepts of the Western philosophical tradition. Ranging from epistemology and aesthetics to the philosophy of history, religion, and politics, <i>Songs of Experience</i> brilliantly traces the major lines of theory and debate. Insightful, rich, and masterfully narrated, Jay's book sings with that well-tempered voice of erudition, synthetic intelligence, and generous grace that has become his enviable trademark."&#x2015;Richard Shusterman, author of <i>Pragmatist Aesthetics</i><br><br>"This illuminating, provocative volume consolidates Martin Jay's standing as our leading modern intellectual historian. Ranging sure-footedly from ancient to postmodern discourse, Jay offers finely balanced readings of thinkers who have wrestled with the elusive concept of experience. Because Jay respects&#x2015;and presents so clearly and sympathetically&#x2015;positions different from his own, Songs of Experience gives readers the resources necessary to embrace or resist his own bold interpretations of philosophers from Kant and Burke through Dilthey and Dewey to Foucault and Rorty.

She has traveled extensively in her adopted country, stopping to savor each region's abundance. A food and wine journalist and culinary historian, her articles on food and travel have appeared in <i>The International Herald Tribune, The St. Louis Riverfront Times</i>, and <i>Sacramento</i> magazine. She is presently writing this volume's sequel, <i>Regional Foods of Southern Italy</i>.</p><p>Marlena de Blasi's life-long love affair with cooking began at age 9 on a beach along the coast of Liguria, Italy. There she met an elderly woman roasting potatoes coated with rosemary, olive oil, and salt over an open fire. "It was then," de Blasi writes, "that I began to understand that the way people eat and drink is more a measure of them than all the other measurements...." In her book, <i>Regional Foods of Northern Italy</i>, de Blasi finds that her adopted homeland is filled with tastes, smells, and textures that evoke far more than great meals--they are the stuff of memory and dreams. <p> <i>Regional Foods of Northern Italy</i> focuses on 10 "gastronomic regions," areas in which the author has worked, lived, and cooked: Tuscana, Umbria, Romagna, Emilia, Veneto, Lombardia, Piemonte, Val D'Aosta, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and Marche. The recipes in this book are, as de Blasi explains, only "interpretations" of these regional cuisines, since it would be nearly impossible to replicate the exact qualities of the local ingredients--the sweet white butter of the Romagnans or the chile peppers of La Marche. Still, wherever it's cooked, <i>Pasta di Alberto Bettini</i>, with its lacing of basalmic vinegar, is a loving expression of its native Emilia, while so simple a meal as olive oil drizzled over bread and eaten with a glass of red wine evokes the ageless hills of Tuscany. Whether you live in Stockholm or San Diego, Marlena de Blasi's fine collection of recipes can transport you--for the length of a meal, at least--on an extraordinary journey through Northern Italy.

His relationship with the fashion journalist Helen Grund was the inspiration for Henri-Pierre Roche's novel <i>Jules et Jim</i> (made into a celebrated 1962 film by Francois Truffaut). In collaboration with Walter Benjamin, Hessel reinvented the Parisian figure of the flaneur. This 1929 book&#x2015;here in its first English translation&#x2015;offers Hessel's version of a flaneur in Berlin.</p><p>In <i>Walking in Berlin,</i> Hessel captures the rhythm of Weimar-era Berlin, recording the seismic shifts in German culture. Nearly all of the essays take the form of a walk or outing, focusing on either a theme or part of the city, and many end at a theater, cinema, or club. Hessel deftly weaves the past with the present, walking through the city's history as well as its neighborhoods.

A cognitive anthropologist and psychologist, Scott Atran argues that religion is a by-product of human evolution just as the cognitive intervention, cultural selection, and historical survival of religion is an accommodation of certain existential and moral elements that have evolved in the human condition.</p><p><br><strong>Scott Atran</strong> is a senior research scientist at the Institut Jean Nicod at the Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in Paris. He is also Adjunct Professor of Anthropology, Psychology, and Natural Resources and the Environment at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. A respected cognitive anthropologist and psychologist, his publications include <em>Fondement de l'histoire naturelle</em>, <em>Cognitive Foundations of Natural History: Towards an Anthropology of Science</em>, and <em>Folk Biology</em>. He has done long-term fieldwork in the Middle East and has also written and experimented extensively on the ways scientists and ordinary people categorize and reason about nature. He currently directs an international, multidisciplinary project on the natural history of the Lowland Maya.<br><br>"<em>In Gods We Trust</em> is by far the best exploration so far of the evolutionary basis of religious behavior."--James Fox, Prof of Anthropology, Stanford University<p></p><br>"With almost 1000 references and discussions of most of human history and culture, from Neanderthal burials to suicide-bombers in the Palestinian anti-colonialist struggle, this book is consciously and truly encyclopedic in scope, and shows both breadth and depth of scholarship...the reader finds himself constantly challenged and provoked into an intellectual ping-pong game as he follows the arguments and the huge body of findings marshalled to buttress them...Atran managed to combine the old and the new by relating the automatic cognitive operations to existential anxieties. This combination will be a benchmark and a challenge to students od religion in all disciplines."--Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi, <em>Human Nature Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Stalin&#39;s Scribe: Literature, Ambition, and Survival: The Life of Mikhail Sholokhov</h2><p><p><strong>A masterful and definitive biography of one of the most misunderstood and controversial writers in Russian literature.</strong></p><p>Mikhail Sholokhov is arguable one of the most contentious recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature. As a young man, Sholokhov&#x2019;s epic novel, <em>Quiet Don</em>, became an unprecedented overnight success.</p><p><em>Stalin&#x2019;s Scribe</em> is the first biography of a man who was once one of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s most prominent political figures.&nbsp; Thanks to the opening of Russia&#x2019;s archives, Brian Boeck discovers that Sholokhov&#x2019;s official Soviet biography is actually a tangled web of legends, half-truths, and contradictions. Boeck examines the complex connection between an author and a dictator, revealing how a Stalinist courtier became an ideological acrobat and consummate politician in order to stay in favor and remain relevant after the dictator&#x2019;s death.</p><p><em>Stalin's Scribe</em> is remarkable biography that both reinforces and clashes with our understanding of the Soviet system. It reveals a Sholokhov who is bold, uncompromising, and sympathetic&#x2015;and reconciles him with the vindictive and mean-spirited man described in so many accounts of late Soviet history.</p><p>Shockingly, at the height of the terror, which claimed over a million lives, Sholokhov became a member of the most minuscule subset of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s population&#x2015;the handful of individuals whom Stalin personally intervened to save.</p> 8 pages of B&amp;W photographs</p><p>Brian J. Boeck holds a Ph.D. in Russian history from Harvard University and have taught Russian and Soviet history for over a decade at DePaul University. He is the author of Imperial Boundaries (Cambridge) and lives in Chicago, Illinois.&#x201c;A provocative and sympathetic new biography. No small achievement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[<em>Stalin&#x2019;s Scribe</em>] tries to explain how Sholokhov lost the conscience he once had. Mr. Boeck observes insightfully that faking one&#x2019;s accomplishments and constructing a false identity were hardly offenses unique to Sholokhov.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Boeck displays his wide range of knowledge of the Soviet Union and delivers an insightful, gripping, squirm-inducing portrait of a great author who loyally served his government&#x2015;perhaps too loyally.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Boeck relates with Dostoyevskian verisimilitude the psychological agonies Sholokhov must have endured at the time. Sholokhov&#x2019;s struggle to stay true to his vision in an atmosphere of blinding darkness is the theme of Boeck&#x2019;s riveting political biography. To his great credit, Boeck himself is never blind to Sholokhov&#x2019;s profound flaws or to the fact that his struggle was largely doomed from the start. Insightful and compelling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Boeck paints a nuanced portrait in this literary biography of a Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning Russian novelist and accused (but exonerated) plagiarist. Boeck&#x2019;s portrayal of his subject&#x2019;s international ill-fame, habit of hiding his emotions, clashes with Stalin&#x2019;s successor Khrushchev, and drinking bouts make this a deeply engaging take on an important literary figure.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An important and stimulating book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Russian Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Excellent. Boeck has written more than a biography of a single writer; he also grants us unexpected insights into the minds of two of the most important Soviet leaders. I hope that Boeck&#x2019;s book will help bring back our attention to a remarkable novel.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Chandler, The Financial Times</strong></p><h2>The Secret Language of Anatomy</h2><p><i>The Secret Language of Anatomy</i> is an initiation into the mysterious subject of anatomical terminology.

Routledge is an imprint of Taylor &amp; Francis, an informa company.</p><p>This biography appears in the midst of a small Sassoon revival. Although not the sprightliest of writers, Jean Moorcroft Wilson gives a comprehensive and well-rounded impression of Sassoon, drawing on much new material, including both sides of his correspondence with T.E. Lawrence. "Unlike the many writers who lead sedentary lives," Wilson notes, "[Sassoon] was a man of action caught up in the bloodiest conflict in history." In the early 1920s, still glowing from the success of his poems of the First World War, Sassoon had imagined he would write a "<i>Madame Bovary</i> dealing with sexual inversion." But the poet who patrolled no man's land at night and whose initially romantic verses gradually came to encompass all the horrors of trench warfare could not find the courage to declare his love for men. One of the benefits of this late biography, as Wilson points out, is that she can now write openly of what Sassoon could not. <i>--Regina Marler</i><strong>Jean Moorcroft Wilson</strong> is Lecturer in English at London University. She has published widely, including biographies of Virginia Woolf, Isaac Rosenberg, Charles Hamilton Sorley and William Watson. She is currently writing the second volume of the Sassoon biography.</p><h2>The Last Pictures</h2><p>Human civilizations' longest lasting artifacts are not the great Pyramids of Giza, nor the cave paintings at Lascaux, but the communications satellites that circle our planet. In a stationary orbit above the equator, the satellites that broadcast our TV signals, route our phone calls, and process our credit card transactions experience no atmospheric drag. Their inert hulls will continue to drift around Earth until the Sun expands into a red giant and engulfs them about 4.5 billion years from now.<br><br><i>The Last Pictures</i>, co-published by Creative Time Books, is rooted in the premise that these communications satellites will ultimately become the cultural and material ruins of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, far outlasting anything else humans have created. Inspired in part by ancient cave paintings, nuclear waste warning signs, and Carl Sagan's Golden Records of the 1970s, artist/geographer Trevor Paglen has developed a collection of one hundred images that will be etched onto an ultra-archival, golden silicon disc. The disc, commissioned by Creative Time, will then be sent into orbit onboard the Echostar XVI satellite in September 2012, as both a time capsule and a message to the future.<br><br>The selection of 100 images, which are the centerpiece of the book, was influenced by four years of interviews with leading scientists, philosophers, anthropologists, and artists about the contradictions that characterize contemporary civilizations. Consequently, <i>The Last Pictures</i> engages some of the most profound questions of the human experience, provoking discourse about communication, deep time, and the economic, environmental, and social uncertainties that define our historical moment.<br><br><i>Copub: Creative Time Books</i></p><p><b>Trevor Paglen</b> is an internationally recognized artist, writer, and scholar working across multiple disciplines in a variety of media. Among his books are <i>Blank Spots on the Map</i>, <i>Torture Taxi</i>, and <i>I Could Tell You But Then You Would Have to Be Destroyed by Me</i>. His art is in the permanent collections of numerous museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Smithsonian Museum of American Art.The book showcases a diversity of photographic technologies, from surveillance shots taken by a drone to close-ups of the Ebola virus captured by an electron micrograph; this shuffling together of radically disparate scales makes for a thought-provoking browsing experience. <i>The Last Pictures</i> tells a dark but urgent story about present conditions of representational frustration.

Exchanging vows of love with sailor Frank Aldersley the night before his departure, Clara Burnham is haunted by the memory of Richard Wardour, and his mistaken belief that they will one day marry. On different ships, the two men have no cause to meet&#x2014;until disaster strikes and they find themselves united by their battle for survival. When they learn of their rivalry, there follows an act of pure selflessness, making <i>The Frozen Deep</i> one of Collins' most moving and tragic works. The author of <i>The Moonstone, The Woman in White, </i>and <i>Who Killed Zebedee?,</i> Wilkie Collins is widely regarded as the originator of the English detective novel.</p><p>Wilkie Collins was born in 1824. A close friend and contemporary of Charles Dickens, Collins became one of the best known of Victorian fiction writers. He wrote 25 novels, 50 short stories, 15 plays, and over 100 non-fiction pieces. His work showed the beginnings of detective fiction and horror writing. He died on September 23, 1889.</p><h2>Sketches of Young Gentlemen and Young Couples: With Sketches of Young Ladies by Edward Caswall (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Praised by acclaimed biographer Claire Tomalin as "young Dickens at his most playful," this delightful volume showcases two collections of little-known sketches by Dickens, charmingly illustrated by Phiz. Whimsical, satirical, witty and exuberant, the sketches ridicule the behavior of their subjects with perfect comic effect, offering fascinating evidence of a writer learning his craft and refining his style. In his Introduction, Dickens scholar Paul Schlicke discusses the popularity of the sketch mode, and the special qualities of these examples. This unique edition includes Edward Caswall's <em>Sketches of Young Ladies</em>, whose success prompted Dickens to write his own sketches.<br></p><p><br><strong>Paul Schlicke</strong> is Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Aberdeen.<br><br>"By presenting these little-known Dickens sketches in the company of the work that preceded and partially inspired them, Paul Schlicke recovers their contemporary literary milieu and allows us to see them as more than mere harbingers of future greatness. It would be difficult to find a better qualified editor for this work." --<em>Review 19</em><p></p><br>"The young Dickens at his most playful, writing anonymously and slyly observant of the manners and morals of the 1830s, when he was himself a young gentleman and one member of a young couple. Paul Schlicke's delightful edition includes the original Phiz illustrations." --Claire Tomalin, author of <em>Charles Dickens: A Life</em><p></p><br>"So little known they qualify as 'new Dickens,' and as hugely enjoyable socio-comic writing from his most exuberant phase. Paul Schlicke is to be thanked for bringing them to our attention in his handsomely embellished volume." --John Sutherland, author of <em>How Literature Works</em><p></p><br>"I've loved reading the Sketches - a delicious and illuminating part of the vast hidden forest of unknown Dickens, enchanting and surprising, and beautifully introduced by Dr Schlicke." --Simon Callow<p></p><br>"A taxonomy of archetypes that is at once amusingly outdated and surprisingly timely. Though its blend of humor and astute cultural observation captures a bygone era beautifully, its tease-points could easily apply to today's crop of hipsters, techies, and other social performative roles we all don." -- <em>Brain Pickings</em><p></p><br>"Interesting and fun to read.

Samuel Bowles answers with a resounding &#x201c;no.&#x201d; Policies that follow from this paradigm, he shows, may &#x201c;crowd out&#x201d; ethical and generous motives and thus backfire.<br> &nbsp;<br> But incentives per se are not really the culprit. Bowles shows that crowding out occurs when the message conveyed by fines and rewards is that self-interest is expected, that the employer thinks the workforce is lazy, or that the citizen cannot otherwise be trusted to contribute to the public good. Using historical and recent case studies as well as behavioral experiments, Bowles shows how well-designed incentives can crowd <i>in</i> the civic motives on which good governance depends.</p><p><b>Samuel Bowles</b> directs the Behavioral Sciences Program at the Santa Fe Institute and is the author of <i>Microeconomics: Behavior, Institutions, and Evolution</i><i>; <i>A Cooperative Species: Human Reciprocity and Its Evolution </i></i>(with Herbert Gintis);<i></i>and<i><i>The New Economics of Inequality and Redistribution</i>.</i>"In his tightly argued and illuminating book, Bowles makes the case that appeals made to our self-interest can undercut instinctive moral impulses; and that when these impulses are weakened crucial institutions work sub-optimally, if not at all."&#x2014;Robert Armstrong, <i>Financial Times</i><br>"Bowles has written a thought-provoking book, full of insights and evidence."&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br>"Fascinating and thought-provoking."&#x2014;<i>Democracy: A Journal of Ideas</i><br><p>"The book does an excellent job of covering the existing research regarding incentives and human behavior and synthesizing it into an understandable format.

Dagmar Herzog's outstanding, disturbing, and ultimately fascinating anthology is the first to seriously historicize this most sensitive topic. Sexual desire was enmeshed in brutal violence all over Europe's most destructive century, but it was so in surprisingly diverse ways. A pathbreaking reference book and a must-read for each student of military history, gender history, and Holocaust and genocide studies.'</p> <p> Thomas K�hne, Clark University, USA</p> <p>'This wonderful book makes a powerful contribution to the history of Europe in the 20th century. With their complex and comparative treatment of wars from the Armenian genocide, to the Holocaust, colonization and decolonization, and the recent conflict in the Balkans these collected essays carefully historicize the meanings and modalities of sexualized violence and sexual desire. Together they brilliantly demonstrate the intimate and integral ties between the history of sexuality and the history of European war.'</p> <p>- Judith Surkis, Centre for European Studies, Harvard University, USA</p> <p>'Scholars and instructors from a broad range of disciplines (European history, military history, gender studies, imperialism, racism) will be grateful for this path-breaking collection of essays that analyze the complex intersections of sexuality and war from the Armenian genocide to the Balkan Wars of the 1990s. By focusing not only on sexual violence but also on desire and the consensual sexuality made possible by the dislocation and anonymity of war, the authors of this fine book also provide an important history of both female and male sexuality during Europe's bloody century.'</p> <p>- Maria H�hn, Vassar College, USA</p> <p> 'Astonishing and unforgettable, this book is one of a kind. Its explorations into the taboo territory of sex and war span the 20th century, from Anatolia to Ethiopia, Auschwitz, Algeria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and points between and beyond. These chapters are as remarkable for the deep particularity they exhibit in each case as for the powerful and urgently universal nature of the viciousness, pain, exhilaration, and desire they reveal. Dagmar Herzog has assembled a compelling, indeed, indisputable case for the inseparability of war and sex, in all their manifestations.'</p> <p>- Doris L. Bergen, University of Toronto, Canada</p> <p>'This history of sexuality risks a great deal. It confronts the issue of sexual violence against women, against men, and against children. It also takes on desire and love or, in any case, consensual relationships in times of war. The book succeeds and may serve as a model for further explorations because it is based on remarkably thorough research and on prudence as well as good judgment in making sense of sexuality in times of war.'</p> <p>- Michael Geyer, University of Chicago, USA</p></p><h2>Contemporary Europe: A History (9th Edition)</h2><p><p><b></b> Clearly written and understandably organized, this classic book about European political, social, economic, and intellectual history covers events throughout the Continent from 1914 to the present, treating Europe as a single unit.

In July 1789 he sailed from Cádiz in the purpose-built corvettes, Descubierta and Atrevida. On board the vessels were scientists and artists and an array of the latest surveying and astronomical instruments. The voyage lasted more than five years. On his return Malaspina began work on seven-volume account of the voyage, to dwarf the narratives of his predecessors in the Pacific such as Cook and Bougainville. But he became involved in political intrigue, was imprisoned, and then spent the rest of his life in obscure retirement in Italy. He never resumed work on the great edition, and his journal remained long unpublished. Only now is justice being done to the achievements of what for long was a forgotten voyage. This is the final volume of the series of three which presents Malaspina&#39;s journal for the first time in English translation and with commentary. It covers the expedition&#39;s return voyage from Manila, its visits to New Zealand, Australia, the Tonga Islands and the Falklands, and its arrival in Cádiz on 21 September 1794. Appendices contain Bustamante&#39;s survey of East Falkland Island, his visit to Puerto de la Soledad and his search for Islas Auroras, an account of Malaspina&#39;s arrest and the suppression of his report, and details of the two corvettes with lists of their complement and of the scientific instruments and books taken on the expedition.</p><p>Andrew David served for more than forty years in the Royal Navy, including a period (I961-85) at the Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of Defence.

Containing thirteen papers in all, the book includes both new essays and previously published papers, some of them with extensive new postscripts reflecting Lewis's current thinking. The papers in Volume II focus on causation and several other closely related topics, including counterfactual and indicative conditionals, the direction of time, subjective and objective probability, causation, explanation, perception, free will, and rational decision. Throughout, Lewis analyzes global features of the world in such a way as to show that they might turn out to supervene on the spatiotemporal arrangement of local qualities.<br></p><p>Eleven of the papers in this volume were originally published from 1972 to 1981; misprints apart, they are reprinted in their original form. In some cases, where retractions or additions seemed urgently needed, I have appended postscripts. Two other papers appear here for the first time. The papers in this volume deal with topics concerning counterfactuals, causation, and related matters. Papers in ontology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language have appeared in Volume I. I have left out papers which are rejoinders, or which are primarily technical interest, or which overlap too much with the papers I have included. Abstracts of the omitted papers may be found here, in the bibliography of my writings.David Lewis is at Princeton University.</p><h2>Franklin D. Roosevelt and American Foreign Policy, 1932-1945: With a New Afterword (Oxford Paperbacks)</h2><p>Since the original publication of this classic book in 1979, Roosevelt's foreign policy has come under attack on three main points: Was Roosevelt responsible for the confrontation with Japan that led to the attack at Pearl Harbor? Did Roosevelt "give away" Eastern Europe to Stalin and the U.S.S.R. at Yalta? And, most significantly, did Roosevelt abandon Europe's Jews to the Holocaust, making no direct effort to aid them?<br><br> In a new Afterword to his definitive history, Dallek vigorously and brilliantly defends Roosevelt's policy.

This book is well organized, well produced, and well written. It belongs among the ten most useful books on this period to the historian and... to the general reader." &#x2014;American Historical Review</p><p>"This splendid volume fills a gap in the vast outpouring of literature on the military aspects of the era of the French Revolution and Napoleon by combining a description of the major changes and trends of warfare with a comparative discussion of the French military establishment and the armies of its major opponents....

He also explores staff systems, logistics, fortifications, medical services, and insurgency and counterinsurgency.</p></p><p>Some 12 years ago it was estimated that well over 300,000 works existed on this period and since then several thousand more have appeared. Therefore, it might be reasonably argued that there is little room for another volume. Nonetheless, this vast outpouring of literature has usually dealt with major leaders, specific battles or campaigns, and with certain branches of the service. Moreover, at least in English, the literature tends to concentrate primarily on the French or British armies. There appears to be a lack of works combining a description of the major changes and trends in the art of war, especially at the cutting edge of events, with a discussion of the French military establishment and the armies of the major opponents, British as well as continental. And while this book is only a brief survey, I do believe that it may serve as a contribution towards filling this gap in our historical knowledge of military institutions and fighting men.</p><h2>Social Research Methods: Qualitative and Quantitative Approaches</h2><p><p>At last, a social research methods text for students and future researchers who will need to use both words and numbers in their research.

This revolutionary business strategy allows manufacturers to adjust product volume and mix every day in the direction of actual sales. The strategic business advantages of DFT forces engineering towards process design to improve their speed-to-market by bringing new products to the market ahead of the competition as well as meeting customer demand. DFT strategically will maximize manufacturing and financial assets. This strategy impacts all organizations in a company.<br>In the mathematically-based Demand Flow Technology, work is defined using linear and Takt techniques to design mixed-model flow lines and processes. Companies no longer use MRP systems to schedule fabricated items and subassemblies, nor do they issue material based upon production work orders. The end result is an ongoing sequence of products in a flow process that replenishes from other internal processes and external suppliers based upon actual customer demand.<br>This book defines the DFT business, design and manufacturing techniques and compares them to traditional functional manufacturing.

Here, he became Hilbert's assistant. He returned to G�ttingen to continue his research after World War I, and founded and headed the university's Mathematical Institute. In 1933, Courant left Germany for England, from whence he went on to the United States after a year. In 1936, he became a professor at the New York University. Here, he headed the Department of Mathematics and was Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences - which was subsequently renamed the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Among other things, Courant is well remembered for his achievement regarding the finite element method, which he set on a solid mathematical basis and which is nowadays the most important way to solve partial differential equations numerically.</p><h2>Basic Contract Law, Concise Edition (American Casebook Series)</h2><p>The Concise Edition is a stream-lined version for a four unit course.

The Spanish colonial rule which followed the conquest exploited basic mineral resources in the area without bringing either stability or wealth to the existing population, and unfortunately, economic depression and civil war have frequently left their pockmarks on Peruvian history ever since. In this book, Klaren explores the country's long history, with particular emphasis on social and economic issues, from pre-Incan times to 1995. Organized chronologically, the text also discusses the major themes of Peru's past, focusing not only on prominent figures, but on the daily lives of ordinary people as well.<br></p><p>Peter Flindell Klaren is at The George Washington University."Klaren's history of Peru will stand as the standard survey of Peru for decades to come. The broad range of his research is quite impressive. Unlike most studies in the Oxford series, which heavily stress economic developments, often at the expense of social and political aspects, Klaren's<br>work offers a more balanced account. In addition, significant attention is paid to the role of the military in twentieth-centruy affairs. The bibliography is a model of completeness and will be a valuable aid to scholars."--Daniel M. Masterson, Professor, United States Navel Academy, Annapolis,<br>Maryland</p><h2>Wonder Beyond Belief: On Christianity</h2><p><p>What happens when one of Germany&#x2019;s most important writers, himself a Muslim, immerses himself in the world of Christian art? In this book, Navid Kermani is awestruck by a religion full of sacrifice and lamentation, love and wonder, the irrational and the unfathomable, the deeply human and the divine &#x2013; a Christianity that today&#x2019;s Christians rarely speak of so earnestly, boldly and enthusiastically.<br> <br> With the open-minded curiosity of a non-believer &#x2013; or rather a believer in another faith &#x2013; Kermani engages with Christian art in its great richness and diversity. The result is an enchanting reflection which reinvests in Christianity both its spectacular beauty and its terror. Kermani struggles with the cross, falls in love at the sight of Mary, experiences the Orthodox Mass and appreciates the greatness of St Francis. He teaches us to see the questions of our present-day lives in the pictures of old masters such as Botticelli, Caravaggio and Rembrandt &#x2013; not with lectures on art history or theology, but with an intelligent eye for the essential details and the underlying relations to seemingly remote worlds, to literature and to mystical Islam.<br> <br> Kermani&#x2019;s poetic school of seeing draws us in as we are carried along by his unique perspective on Christianity, rekindling our interest in great art at the same time. We are captivated by his unique and brilliant Islamic reading of the West.</p></p><p><p><b>Navid Kermani</b> is a writer and scholar who lives in Cologne, Germany. He has received numerous accolades for his literary and academic work, including the 2015 Peace Prize of the German Publishers&#x2019; Association, Germany&#x2019;s most prestigious cultural award.<b><br> </b></p><p>"A work of genius"&nbsp;<br><b>Ian Sansom, The Guardian</b><br><br>"This truly is one of the best books I've read in years: funny, outrageous, touching, intimate, glorious."<br><b>Nicola Barker, The Guardian Best Books of 2017</b><br><br>"Navid Kermani has written one of the funniest, most perceptive, outrageous and engaging books about art, life and faith that I have ever read... It&#x2019;s wonderful. It&#x2019;s cathartic. It's transformative."<br><b>The Spectator</b><br><br>"An astonishing, deeply sympathetic, constantly surprising meditation on Christianity from one of the greatest Muslim writers and thinkers in the Western world. Kermani writes perceptively about individual works of art and particular places, about the New Testament, and about the rich traditions of Christian theology and practice. Still more important, he articulates a vision of Islamic&#x2013;Christian friendship that is, in our vexed world, a human gift of rare importance." <br><b>Stephen Greenblatt, Cogan University Professor of the Humanities, Harvard University<br></b><br>"In this beautifully written book, Navid Kermani performs something which, if not unprecedented, is still highly unusual, as he considers Christianity from the distance of a different faith. He does not claim any superiority here, quite the opposite. Unencumbered by the need to accept or reject, he explores the Christian faith with an alert interest and consuming curiosity. Through his keen gaze, coupled with a profound knowledge of theology and art history, Kermani captivates readers with the marvels of artworks that they might otherwise never really notice. The anglophone world needs and deserves this gem of a book."<br><b>Daniel Boyarin, University of California, Berkeley</b></p> <p>"In this book Navid Kermani draws on his unique perspectives as a Muslim intellectual to offer thoughtful reflections on the complex divine ideas underlying Christian art and the deep parallels that can be drawn between it and other traditions, including mystical Islam. As an outside observer of Christianity, Kermani reminds us that the great faith traditions have more in common than they have difference and how, at the end of the day, we all pay tribute to the same divine spirit. May more Muslim and Christian thinkers alike be inspired by his deep reflectiveness and willingness to engage across faith traditions."<br><b>Ambassador Akbar Ahmed, Ibn Khaldun Chair of Islamic Studies, American University, Washington, DC<br><br></b></p> <p>"When I lived in Deir Mar Musa, Paolo Dall&#x2019;Oglio would sometimes press a &#x201c;very important&#x201d; book on me to read.

His &#x201c;wonder&#x201d; at art in the Christian &#x2013; mainly Catholic &#x2013; tradition is expansive, responsive, humane and imaginative. Sometimes it is also very funny. His curiosity as both a scholar and an art lover is prodigious and infectious... His very openness means that looking at Christianity and its art through his eyes can be moving, entertaining, illuminating, uncomfortable and very rewarding.&#x2019;<br><b>Art and Christianity<br><br></b>&#x201c;Many Christians, and especially many Catholics, will learn a great deal not just about the Islamic point of view, but about what they think of as their own true faith...

Ranked with Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, and James Joyce in the pantheon of European modernists, Musil attempted to apply the precision of his scientific training to the utmost bounds of the imagination. In a series of notebooks kept through most of his literary career, Musil reflected, often through stunning epigrams, on his childhood, his erotic life, his methods of creative thought and his fellow writers. An indispensable guide to his fiction, essays and plays, the pages of the diaries provide a skeleton key for his complex unfinished masterpiece <i>The Man Without Qualities. </i> Known for extreme personal reticence among his contemporaries, Musil in the diaries <i></i> (which were never intended for publication), speaks nakedly of himself and the chaotic events he lived through.This selection from the diaries is based on the exhaustive 1976 German edition prepared by Adolf Fris�. Most of its sketches, anecdotes and personal reflections have been translated into English. An acute political and cultural observer, Musil recorded in these pages his experiences of Berlin at the outbreak of World War I and service in the Austrian army on the Italian Front. The last notebooks chronicle Hitler's rise to power and Musil's exile in Switzerland. The diaries are valuable in a number of ways: as a first-hand historical document of life in twentieth century central Europe, as a kind of unwitting autobiography of a great novelist, and as a writer's workbook that details the moods of artistic adventure.In the diaries Robert Musil challenged himself to think about a reality beyond the world that could be apprehended by logic, to entertain the possibilities of forbidden eroticism, to imagine the hidden mystical life of Fascist Europe, and to turn the question of sexual gender into the puzzle of identity.</p><p>Born into an affluent Austrian family in 1880, Robert Musil died penniless 62 years later, a solitary, bitter man who felt his genius had gone unrecognized. Certainly Musil's name is not nearly as well known as those of his contemporaries Marcel Proust, James Joyce, or Thomas Mann; still, the old man's shade might take some comfort in the critical and popular response his unfinished masterpiece, <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, has garnered in recent years. Its latest, 1995 translation revived interest in an author many consider one of the greatest--if least read--writers of the 20th century. Readers who want to know more about the man behind <i>The Man</i> are in luck: Robert Musil's <i>Diaries</i> are now available in English. <p> Musil was an inveterate diarist; while the German edition of his journals is comprehensive, its translator and English-language editor, Phillip Payne, has chosen to be more selective. Gone are entries that summarize or excerpt the work of other authors; those that are "unintelligible to all but Musil experts"; early drafts of works that are not of particular interest; or entries that add little of significance to our understanding of Musil's life or work. What's left, however, is more than adequate, and provides a fascinating window into the life, times, and creative process of a literary master. There are Musil's working notes to himself ("Set up at least 100 figures, the main human types in existence today: the Expressionist, the Courths-Mahler, the profiteer, the psycho-pedagogue, the disciple of Steiner, etc. Then have these figures crossing each other's paths"); comments about his world ("My generation was anti-moral or amoral because our fathers talked of morality and acted in a philistine and immoral fashion ... children today are moral, but want people to take morality seriously"); and meditations on the most private aspects of his personal life (discussing his wife, Martha, he writes, "She isn't anything that I have gained or achieved; she is something that I have become and that has become "I"). Robert Musil's <i>Diaries</i> are a remarkable portrait of the artist throughout his life and a standing testimony to his genius. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Robert Musil (1880-1942) spent much of his life writing <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, which remained unfinished at the time of his death.

Scott Fitzgerald Collection)</h2><p>A social satire and a milestone in 20th century literature, &#39;The Great Gatsby&#39; peels away the layers of the glamorous twenties in the U.S. to display the coldness and cruelty at its heart.</p><p>In 1922, F. Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something <i>new</i>--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, <i>Gatsby</i> captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream. <p> It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. "Her voice is full of money," Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout. Spare, elegantly plotted, and written in crystalline prose, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> is as perfectly satisfying as the best kind of poem.</p>This critical edition of The Great Gatsby draws on the manuscript and surviving proofs of the novel, together with Fitzgerald&#39;s subsequent revisions to key passages to provide the first authoritative text of one of the classic works of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Student Workbook Exercises for Egan&#39;s The Skilled Helper, 10th</h2><p>This manual parallels the main text, THE SKILLED HELPER.

The complex interplay among organic and inorganic solids, air, water, microorganisms, and plant roots in soil is the subject of Soil <b><i>Chemistry</i></b>, a reference pivotal to understanding soil processes and problems.</p> <p>Thoroughly reorganized for ease of use, this updated Third Edition of <b><i>Soil Chemistry</i></b> summarizes the important research and fundamental knowledge in the field in a single, readily usable text, including:</p> <ul> <li>Soil-ion interactions</li> <li>Biogeological cycles and pollution</li> <li>Water and soil solutions</li> <li>Oxidation and reduction</li> <li>Inorganic solid phase and organic matter in soil</li> <li>Weathering and soil development</li> <li>Cation retention (exchange)</li> <li>Anion and molecular retention</li> <li>Acid and salt-affected soils</li> </ul> <p>New to the Third Edition is an enhanced emphasis on soil solution chemistry and expanded coverage of phosphate chemistry and the chemical principles of the aqueous phase. At the same time, the book has retained the clear examination of the fundamentals of the science of soil that has distinguished earlier editions. Complete with SI units and end-of-chapter study questions, Soil Chemistry is an excellent introductory resource for students studying this crucial topic.</p></p><p>Soil Chemistry, 2nd Edition is a thoroughly updated expansion of the author&#x2019;s highly successful earlier book, linking basic solution and colloidal chemistry, clay mineralogy, and the soil chemistry literature. It describes the major processes of change that soils undergo, including weathering, clay mineral formation, cation retention, and anion and molecular retention. Professors Bohn, McNeal, and O&#x2019;Connor examine the relationship between these processes and the major problems of soil acidity, salinity, and flooded soils, and provide complete coverage of how these processes and problems interact with, and are affected by, the biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Unique features of the second edition include: <ul> <li>a new chapter on soil organic matter, providing greater balance between organic and inorganic soil chemistry</li> <li>SI units now used as the standard measure</li> <li>a chapter of relevant background chemical data to provide a uniform starting point</li> <li>repeated reference to associations from the periodic table and to grouping of elements exhibiting similar properties in soils</li> <li>a list of study questions and annotated bibliography following each chapter</li> </ul> Soil Chemistry, 2nd Edition offers a broad-based view in which the authors express their opinions on a variety of historical and current areas. It is a comprehensive introduction to the subject for science students needing a thorough grounding in soil chemistry, and an invaluable reference to the latest scientific data for researchers in agronomy, ecology, and soil science.DR.

Lawrence left England for the first time, touring Germany, the Alps, and Italy. This classic, his first travel book, records Lawrence&#39;s philosophic responses to his experiences. A powerful underlying theme uniting these essays is the threat of approaching war, and Lawrence&#39;s eerily prophetic article, &#34;With the Guns&#34;, is also included.</p><p>The first critical edition of D. H. Lawrence&#39;s 1912-16 essays. Lawrence left England for the first time in May 1912, and began to record his reactions to foreign cultures. In 1915 he amplified some of these essays and wrote others for Twilight in Italy (1916), his first travel book.The son of a miner, the prolific novelist, poet, and travel writer David Herbert Lawrence was born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, in 1885. He attended Nottingham University and found employment as a schoolteacher. His first novel, <i>The White Peacock</i>, was published in 1911, the same year his beloved mother died and he quit teaching after contracting pneumonia. The next year Lawrence published <i>Sons and Lovers</i> and ran off to Germany with Frieda Weekley, his former tutor&#x2019;s wife. His masterpieces <i>The Rainbow</i> and <i>Women in Love</i> were completed in quick succession, but the first was suppressed as indecent and the second was not published until 1920. Lawrence&#x2019;s lyrical writings challenged convention, promoting a return to an ideal of nature where sex is seen as a sacrament. In 1928 Lawrence&#x2019;s final novel, <i>Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover</i>, was banned in England and the United States for indecency. He died of tuberculosis in 1930 in Venice.</p><h2>Tort Law</h2><p>Practical and easy-to-read, TORT LAW, Fifth Edition is a must-have for anyone preparing for a career as a paralegal.

With regard to organization, the material is presented logically and in accordance with how I think students will be able to start to understand what tort law is all about. It starts out slow and builds on important concepts as the book progresses. With regard to visual presentation, the book does a great job of presenting the material in an easily accessible format. Important concepts are clearly delineated throughout the chapters in a logical fashion. With regard to real world application, it&#39;s important for students to grasp how the concepts are applied in the real world. This text does a great job in providing realistic examples throughout the text material in addition to the generous case opinions.&#34;</p><h2>The Life of an Unknown</h2><p><i>"My task is piecing together a puzzle... I hope to reconstitute the existence of a person whose memory has been abolished.... I want to re-create him, to give him a second chance... to become part of the memory of his century." </i><br><br>With these words, Alain Corbin embarks on a journey that is part history and part metaphysics: recreating the life and world of a man about whom nothing is known except for his entries in the civil registries and historical knowledge about the times in which he lived. Risen from death and utter obscurity is Louis-Fran�ois Pinagot, a forester and clog maker who lived during the heart of the nineteenth century&#x2015;the age of Romanticism, of Hugo and Berlioz&#x2015;from the Napoleonic Wars to the Third Republic.<br><br>The result is a fascinating picture of the way people lived along the forest's edge during this tumultuous and eventful time in the history of France&#x2015;and of the world. How did the residents of this unique community live and work together? How did life in the village differ from life in the forest? How did the church and various governments of France affect the everyday lives of these people, and of Pinagot in particular? With <i>The Life of an Unknown, </i>Alain Corbin presents a full record of a life, comprised of supposition, with room for each reader to insert his/her own imaginings onto the scene. <br><br>Ambitious in its aims and exquisite in its execution, <i>The Life of an Unknown </i>is nothing short of a bold and successful attempt by a master to correct historians' all-too-common neglect of those relegated to oblivion with the passage of time.</p><p>Corbin recreates the life and world of a man about whom nothing is known except for his entries in the civil registries and historical knowledge about the times in which he lived: Louis-Fran�ois Pinagot, a forester and clog maker who lived during the heart of the nineteenth century&#x2015;the age of Romanticism, of Hugo and Berlioz&#x2015;from the Napoleonic Wars to the Third Republic.Alain Corbin is a professor at University of Paris I Panth�on Sorbonne.

It was an especially important subject in nineteenth century analysis and it has now been revived with the appearance of symbolic languages. The authors use the problem of exact evaluation of definite integrals as a starting point for exploring many areas of mathematics. The questions discussed are as old as calculus itself. In presenting the combination of methods required for the evaluation of most integrals, the authors take the most interesting-rather than the shortest-path to the results. They illuminate connections with many subjects, including analysis, number theory, algebra and combinatorics. This is a guided tour of exciting discovery for undergraduates and their teachers in mathematics, computer science, physics, and engineering.</p><p>The problem of evaluating integrals is well known to every student who has had a year of calculus.

Here they are joined with a stimulating text by Dr Kurt Benirschke affording the reader an opportunity to discover the lives and habits of these animals and what the outlook is for their survival.<br><br>Extinction, the tragic and permanent loss of entire species of animals, should be a concern for everyone This concern and a strong desire to take action toward preventing the loss of more animals has brought about an unusual collaboration between art and science. The result is this beautiful volume in which artist and scientist have joined efforts to inform and inspire others to take action.&nbsp;It is hoped that these fascinating and striking portrayals will stimulate readers to join their own energies and talents to this important fight against the loss of more species. <br><br>This book brings some of the less well known endangered animals to the reader's attention. These animals deserve just as much attention as the giant panda or the mountain gorilla about which so much has already been said.&nbsp;Naturally, the animals presented here are very personal choices, having been selected from a virtually endless supply of animals whose last hour is rapidly approaching. <br></p><p>Andy Warhol was one of the most creative artists, widely known for his highly innovative portraits and representations of popular culture. In 1983, Warhol expressed his love of animals and concern for the environment in a series of 10 prints of Endangered Species. For this volume, he returned to this subject, creating 16 new prints.&nbsp;<br>Kurt Benirschke, MD, is well known for his work in pathology and widely published in that field. Benirschke's interest in conservation is more than a "hobby," one to which he is extremely devoted. For many years he has helped to rescue endangered species through breeding in captivity and conservation in the wild. Benirschke is Professor of Pathology and Reproductive Medicine at the University of California, San Diego, and is Trustee and former Director of Research of the San Diego Zoo.A truly unique collaboration of contemporary art and science. Benirschke provides "insight into the issues that are faced by conservationists currently working in zoos." He does this by devoting one chapter to each of 15 less-known endangered species from around the world (e.g., the okapi). He succinctly describes the zoology of the species, its environmental problems, and the difficulties these establish for their survival in situ (nature) or ex situ (zoos). Warhol contributes a full-page color print of each creature (silkscreen over collage) to open the sections. The combination is informative and visually rewarding. Strongly recommended. Michael D.

In this book, Nussbaum argues that international political and economic thought must be sensitive to gender difference as a problem of justice, and that feminist thought must begin to focus on the problems of women in the third world. Taking as her point of departure the predicament of poor women in India, she shows how philosophy should undergird basic constitutional principles that should be respected and implemented by all governments, and used as a comparative measure of quality of life across nations. Nussbaum concludes by calling for a new international focus to feminism, and shows through concrete detail how philosophical arguments about justice really do connect with the practical concerns of public policy.

Restak, M.D.</b>, is a neurologist, neuropsychiatrist, and Clinical Professor of Neurology affiliated with the George Washington University Medical Center. He is the author of the bestselling <b>The Brain</b>--a companion to the PBS series of the same name--as well as <b>The Mind, The Brain Has a Mind of Its Own</b>, and <b>The Brain: The Last Frontier</b>. He lives in Washington, D.C..Restak, neurologist and author of numerous popular books on the human brain (including the companion volume to the PBS series The Brain), considers here the effects of aging on the human brain and suggests ways to maintain peak mental performance. Stressing that brain functioning is the most predictive feature of longevity, Restak describes both the cellular mechanisms responsible for aging and the cognitive processes of the mature brain?some of which, he notes, actually improve with age. He discusses the role of neurotransmitters and briefly describes drugs that may compensate for changes that occur in these chemicals over time.

"We are your best fantasy." Michael Bronski runs with that paradoxical notion, arguing that "straights" are correct to believe that homosexuals represent a threat to the values of Western civilization--and that's a <i>good</i> thing. What they fear (and resent) most in homosexuality, Bronski argues, is the ability of homosexuals to simply enjoy themselves, to take the pleasures of sexuality without the cultural baggage of reproductive responsibility and social conformity. Consequently, the "unique position" of homosexuals "as sexual outsiders endows them with an unparalleled vision for cultural and social change."<p> Bronski deftly deals with a dizzying array of post-WWII American history and culture, from the battles between homophile assimilationists and gay liberationists to the media controversy surrounding Pee-Wee Herman's arrest and the rise of lesbian chic. He makes a strong case both for the vitality of gay culture (including sexuality) and the necessity of explicitly recognizing the contributions that it has made and continues to make to mainstream culture. "Only when those in the dominant culture realize that <i>they</i> are better off acting like gay people," Bronski writes, "will the world change and be a better, safer, and more pleasurable place for everyone." <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>'Bronski ranges widely, often with great insight...a nice feature of his approach is that he seeks to understand gay culture and politics not in isolation but in relation to comparable phenomena both past and present." <i>LA Weekly</i></p><h2>Human Factors in the Built Environment</h2><p>Winner of the ASID 2014 Joel Polsky Prize. <i>Human Factors in the Built Environment</i> is a comprehensive and up-to-date resource that integrates the relationship of the human body and space planning to the design process for designers involved with the physical planning and detailing of interiors.

The first part is the more descriptive, and geological of the two. It deals with the concept of water resources, which then leads us on to other links in the cycle: rainfall, infiltration, evaporation. runoff, and surface water resources. The second part is necessary in order to quantify ground water resources. It points the way to other applications, such as solutions to civil engineering problems including drainage and compaction; and transport problems in porous media, including aquifer pollution by miscible fluids, multiphase flow of immiscible fluids, and heat transfer in porous media, i.e., geothermal problems. However, the qualitative and the quantitative aspects are not treated separately but combined and blended together, just as geology and hydrology are woven together in hydrogeology.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)"Though the book is intended for engineers with a mathematical background, it can be read by hydrologists and geologists as well....The subject is covered comprehensively, and the presentation is very clear."<br>--GEOPHYSICS, ASTROPHYSICS, FLUID DYNAMICS</p><h2>Into Disaster: Chronicles of Intellectual Life, 1941</h2><p><p>The German occupation of France put an end to Maurice Blanchot&#x2019;s career as a political journalist.

The Roman Empire</p><p><b>Augustus and the Imperial Settlement</b></p><p>The roots of that Empire in which the Christian faith was born ran deep and in many directions, not only into the Roman Republic but also into the Macedonian Empire of Alexander, and the Greek city states. Eventually, the Empire was able to seek philosophical justification in the cosmopolitanism of developed Stoicism (see 73-81); but at first it needed no justification beyond its own achievements. A world weary of civil war with its attendant social and economic disturbance and distress was prepared to welcome the victor of Actium as a saviour -- after all, what more did the average man ask of his gods than the peace, security, and social welfare Augustus gave him? Of course, there were some malcontents. The senatorial families deplored changes which deprived them of the substance of power and placed it in the hands of one man, armed with an Ultimate, if generally veiled, authority over life and property. But to the majority the Senate mattered little, and the provinces knew that they were far better governed than ever they had been under the Republic.</p><p>The character, motives, and intentions of Augustus; the political basis of the imperial constitution; the varying relations between the Emperors and the Senate -- these all present historical problems of unusual depth and complexity. Here, at the risk of undue simplification, will be given only a few passages illustrating the work of Augustus and some of the succeeding Emperors.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p><b><i>Res Gestae Divi Augusti</i> 12f., 24-7, 3 4 f</b></p><p>Towards the close of his life, Augustus deposited with the Vestal Virgins four documents. One was his will, disposing of his personal property. Of the remaining three, one contained directions for the celebration of his funeral, another an account of the things he had done (rerum a se gestarum; Suetonius, Augustus 1 0 1), and the third a military and financial account of the state of the Empire. The brass tablets on which, pursuant to Augustus's instructions, the Res Gestae were engraved have not been found; but the greater part of the document has been recovered from a bilingual (GreekLatin) inscription in the temple of Rome and Augustus at Ancyra (the Monumentum Ancyranum), now supplemented by a Greek text found at Apollonia (in Pisidia) and a Latin found at Pisidian Antioch. There can be little doubt that the Res Gestae were compiled partly for the purposes of propaganda; but the substantial accuracy of the facts contained in them seems to fail only through a few small lapses of memory.</p><p>At the same time, by decree of the Senate, a portion of the praetors and tribunes of the plebs, together with the consul, Q. Lucretius, and other men of note, were sent as far as Campania to meet my arrival, an honour which up to this day has been decreed to none other but myself.</p><p>When in the consulship of Tiberius Nero and P. Quintilius I returned to Rome from Spain and Gaul after settling the affairs of those provinces with success, the Senate, to commemorate my return, ordered an altar to Pax Augusta to be consecrated in the CampusMartius, at which it decreed that the magistrates, priests, and Vestal Virgins should celebrate an anniversary sacrifice.</p><p>Whereas our ancestors have willed that the gateway of Janus Quirinus should be shut, whenever victorious peace is secured by sea and by land throughout the empire of the Roman people, andwhereas before my birth twice only in all is it on record that the gateway has been shut, three times under my principate has the Senate decreed that it should be shut....</p><p>After my victory I replaced in the temples of all the communities of the province of Asia the ornaments which my adversary in thewar had, after despoiling the temples, taken into his own possession.</p><p>Silver statues of myself, standing or on horseback or sitting in a chariot, were set up in the city to the number of about eighty, which I myself took down, and out of the money value I set up gifts of gold in the temple of Apollo in my own name and in the names of thosewho had honoured me with the statues. I conquered the pirates and gave peace to the seas. In that war I handed over to their masters for punishment nearly 30,000 slaves who had run away from their owners, and taken up arms against the republic.</p><p>The whole of Italy of its own free will took the oath of fidelity tome, and demanded me as its leader in the war of which Actium was the crowning victory. An oath was also taken to the same effect by the provinces of Gaul, Spain, Africa, Sicily, and Sardinia.</p><p>Among those who at that time served under my standards were more than seven hundred senators; out of that number, either beforethat date or afterwards, up to the day on which these records were written, eighty-three attained the consulship, and about one hundred and seventy were elected to priesthoods.</p><p>I extended the frontiers of all the provinces of the Roman people, which had as neighbours races not obedient to our empire.</p><p>I restored peace to all the provinces of Gaul and Spain and to Germany, to all that region washed by the Ocean from Gades to the mouth of the Elbe.</p><p>Peace too I caused to be established in the Alps from the region nearest to the Hadriatic as far as the Tuscan sea, while no tribe was wantonly attacked by war.</p><p>My fleet sailed along the Ocean from the mouth of the Rhine as far towards the east as the borders of the Cimbri, whither no Roman before that time had penetrated either by land or sea.

Since Hemingway&#39;s personal papers were released in 1979, scholars have examined and debated the changes made to the text before publication. Now this new special restored edition presents the original manuscript as the author prepared it to be published. Featuring a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, Ernest&#39;s sole surviving son, and an introduction by the editor and grandson of the author, Sean Hemingway, this new edition also includes a number of unfinished, never-before-published Paris sketches revealing experiences that Hemingway had with his son Jack and his first wife, Hadley. Also included are irreverent portraits of other luminaries, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford, and insightful recollections of his own early experiments with his craft. Sure to excite critics and readers alike, the restored edition of A Moveable Feast brilliantly evokes the exuberant mood of Paris after World War I and the unbridled creativity and enthusiasm that Hemingway himself experienced. In the world of letters it is a unique insight into a great literary generation, by one of the best American writers of the twentieth century.</p><p>In the preface to <i>A Moveable Feast</i>, Hemingway remarks casually that "if the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction"--and, indeed, fact or fiction, it doesn't matter, for his slim memoir of Paris in the 1920s is as enchanting as anything made up and has become the stuff of legend. Paris in the '20s! Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley, lived happily on $5 a day and still had money for drinks at the Closerie des Lilas, skiing in the Alps, and fishing trips to Spain. On every corner and at every caf� table, there were the most extraordinary people living wonderful lives and telling fantastic stories. Gertrude Stein invited Hemingway to come every afternoon and sip "fragrant, colorless alcohols" and chat admid her great pictures. He taught Ezra Pound how to box, gossiped with James Joyce, caroused with the fatally insecure Scott Fitzgerald (the acid portraits of him and his wife, Zelda, are notorious). Meanwhile, Hemingway invented a new way of writing based on this simple premise: "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know."<p> Hemingway beautifully captures the fragile magic of a special time and place, and he manages to be nostalgic without hitting any false notes of sentimentality. "This is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy," he concludes. Originally published in 1964, three years after his suicide, <i>A Moveable Feast</i> was the first of his posthumous books and remains the best. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Grammar as Science (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>An introduction to the study of syntax that also introduces students to the principles of scientific theorizing.</b></p><p>This introductory text takes a novel approach to the study of syntax. <i>Grammar as Science</i> offers an introduction to syntax as an exercise in scientific theory construction. Syntax provides an excellent instrument for introducing students from a wide variety of backgrounds to the principles of scientific theorizing and scientific thought; it engages general intellectual themes present in all scientific theorizing as well as those arising specifically within the modern cognitive sciences. The book is intended for students majoring in linguistics as well as non-linguistics majors who are taking the course to fulfill undergraduate requirements. <i>Grammar as Science</i> covers such core topics in syntax as phrase structure, constituency, the lexicon, inaudible elements, movement rules, and transformational constraints, while emphasizing scientific reasoning skills. The individual units are organized thematically into sections that highlight important components of this enterprise, including choosing between theories, constructing explicit arguments for hypotheses, and the conflicting demands that push us toward expanding our technical toolkit on the one hand and constraining it on the other. </p><p><i>Grammar as Science</i> is constructed as a &#x201c;laboratory science&#x201d; course in which students actively experiment with linguistic data. Syntactica, a software application tool that allows students to create and explore simple grammars in a graphical, interactive way, is available online in conjunction with the book. Students are encouraged to &#x201c;try the rules out,&#x201d; and build grammars rule-by-rule, checking the consequences at each stage.</p></p><p>Richard K. Larson is Professor of Linguistics at Stony Brook University."<br><br>"What makes modern generative linguistics a science, and an interesting one at that, is a subtle interaction among several factors: the questions that it asks, the abstractions that it makes to answer these questions, the technical apparatus it uses to make these questions precise, the evidence it uses to adjudicate between different answers, and the aesthetic that animates it when putting all these ingredients together. Richard Larson is the perfect guide into these complex matters and his book an ideal road map. Though written for the neophyte, even the cognoscenti will benefit from his careful, clear, verbal, and visual exposition of what makes linguistics one of the great intellectual success stories of recent times."--Norbert Hornstein, Department of Linguistics, University of Maryland<br><br>"Larson's book is an engaging and delightfully lucid introduction to the scientific nature of linguistic argumentation. While thoroughly covering the basics of syntax, it also shows students explicitly how to 'think like a linguist.' Students who use this book will come away with an extraordinarily strong grasp of the real underpinnings of linguistics."--Peggy Speas, Department of Linguistics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst<br><br>""Grammar as Science" is an excellent textbook for an introductory syntax course, serving both intended linguistics majors and the general education population equally well.

Since children and young teenagers are most able to sense the ghosts, psychically gifted youths are employed by agencies large and small, and use iron chains, magnesium flares, and salt bombs to contain and dispatch the Visitors. Narrator Lucy Carlyle has moved to London following a ghost-hunting mission gone very wrong, and her luck improves when she joins a small, independent outfit run by the dashing Anthony Lockwood and his studious and exasperating (to Lucy) partner, George Cubbins. Stroud (the Bartimaeus series) shows his customary flair for blending deadpan humor with thrilling action, and the fiery interplay among the three agents of Lockwood &amp; Co. invigorates the story (along with no shortage of creepy moments). Stroud plays with ghost story conventions along the way, while laying intriguing groundwork that suggests that the Problem isn't the only problem these young agents will face in books tocome-the living can be dangerous, too. Ages 8 12. PW"<br><br>Three young ghost trappers take on deadly wraiths and solve an old murder case in the bargain to kick off Stroud's new post-Bartimaeus series. Narrator Lucy Carlyle hopes to put her unusual sensitivity to supernatural sounds to good use by joining the Lockwood &amp; Co.-one of several firms that have risen to cope with the serious ghost Problem that has afflicted England in recent years. As its third member, she teams with glib, ambitious Anthony Lockwood and slovenly-but-capable scholar George Cubbins to entrap malign spirits for hire. The work is fraught with peril, not only because a ghost's merest touch is generally fatal, but also, as it turns out, as none of the three is particularly good at careful planning and preparation. All are, however, resourceful and quick on their feet, which stands them in good stead when they inadvertently set fire to a house while discovering a murder victim's desiccated corpse. It comes in handy again when they later rashly agree to clear Combe Carey Hall, renowned for centuries of sudden deaths and regarded as one of England's most haunted manors. Despite being well-stocked with scream-worthy ghastlies, this lively opener makes a light alternative for readers who find the likes of Joseph Delaney's Last Apprentice series too grim and creepy for comfort. A heartily satisfying string of entertaining near-catastrophes, replete with narrow squeaks and spectral howls. (Ghost adventure. 11-13) Kirkus"<br><br>Fifty years after the Problem began in London, it has slowly spread through the country. The public dreads Visitors, malevolent ghosts that can be directly sensed only by children. Young Lucy Carlyle joins Anthony Lockwood and George Cubbins to become Lockwood &amp; Co., three kids using rapiers, iron chains, and magnesium fire to handle Visitors. After they bungle a job by inadvertently burning down a house, their company faces imminent ruin. Their last hope of saving it involves accepting a dicey assignment in one of England's most haunted houses. Despite the necessary time spent framing the series, Stroud ratchets up the tension considerably when the trio goes to work. Still, the most satisfying parts of the book concern the three intriguing main characters and the dynamics of their not-quite-comfortable relationship. Best known for the Bartimaeus books, beginning with The Amulet of Samarkand (2003), Stroud writes for a younger audience in book one of the Lockwood &amp; Co. series and delivers some chilling scenes along the way. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY - Stroud made many fans with the Bartimaeus books, and even though this is for a younger audience, his name carries weight with librarians, teachers, and parents. - Carolyn Phelan Booklist"<br><br>In an alternative England plagued by hauntings, ghostbusting agencies are staffed mostly by Sensitive kids and teens, since only people under the age of eighteen have the psychic abilities to deal with the spirits properly. Young Lucy Carlyle is particularly gifted, though a recent mishap (accidentally burning a house down) while fighting a nasty shade alongside her pal/boss Lockwood might suggest otherwise. The incident brings their agency to the attention of a wealthy businessman who offers to pay for the damage to the house (and save Lockwood &amp; Co. from financial ruin) if they spend the night investigating his recently acquired country home-which also happens to be one of the most haunted places in England. Stroud brings together the seemingly disparate plot points together with his usual combination of thrilling adventure and snarky humor. Fans of his Bartimaeus Trilogy will recognize Lockwood's assistant, George, as a kindred (albeit human) soul to that series' wise-cracking djinni, and indeed, all members of this spirit-smashing trio get in their fair share of zingers, providing a comedic balance to the many narrow escapes, false leads, and shape-shifting specters that otherwise occupy Lockwood &amp; Co. The ghosts themselves are scary but not gory, and the descriptions are vivid without being intense, so that even readers who are traditionally scaredy-cats may very well find the horror here palatable. The world-building skips on the details a bit, but answers to the hows and whys of the spirit epidemic will likely appear in the future installment of this proposed series. KQG BCCB"<br><br>With a morbidly cheery tone and sure-footed establishment of characters and setting, Stroud (the Bartimaeus trilogy; Heroes of the Valley, rev. 1/09) kicks off a new series that is part procedural and part ghost story, with a healthy dash of caper thrown in for good measure. No one knows how the "Problem" began, but ghosts have become the world's worst pest infestation, causing rampant property damage and personal injury, even death. Protagonist Lucy's extreme psychic sensitivity (a talent found only in young people) is rivaled only by her dislike of obeying stupid orders, so she joins Lockwood &amp; Co., a scrappy independent agency run by teenage operatives who scorn the usual requisite adult supervision. After a job goes awry, the agency is forced to take on a high-profile, high-paying haunting from a client who is, of course, not telling them everything. The setup is classic and is executed with panache. Lucy's wry, practical voice counterpoints the suspenseful supernatural goings-on as she, agency owner Anthony Lockwood, and dour associate George attempt to stiff-upper-lip their way through the ultimate haunted house. Tightly plotted and striking just the right balance between creepiness and hilarity, this rollicking series opener dashes to a fiery finish but leaves larger questions about the ghost Problem open for future exploration. CLAIRE E. GROSS Horn Book"<br><br>Gr 6-9 Lucy Carlyle relates the exploits of the teenage ghost-hunting agency, Lockwood &amp; Co&amp;. The world is still reeling from an infestation of malevolent, deadly ghosts that can only be detected by Talented youngsters with rare psychic sensitivities. Anthony Lockwood heads his three-person team, including Lucy and George Cubbins, in their efforts to defeat the evil spirits and remain solvent. A minor haunting that turns into a major problem leads Lockwood &amp; Co. to a brooding mansion that has already claimed the lives of more experienced ghost hunters. Combe Carey Hall is "the most haunted private house in England an ugly oppressive mongrel of a building," and the trio quickly realizes that the dangers they face have human as well as supernatural sources. Authentically spooky events occur in an engagingly crafted, believable world, populated by distinct, colorful personalities. The genuinely likable members of Lockwood &amp; Co. persevere through the evil machinations of the living and the dead and manage to come out with their skins, and their senses of humor, intact. This smart, fast-paced ghostly adventure promises future chills. Janice M.

It is based on the notes from courses I have taught at Indiana State University from 1967 to the present. The preparation needed is an introductory calculus-based course in physics and its prerequisite calculus courses. Courses in vector analysis and differential equations are useful but not required, since the text introduces these topics. In writing this book, I tried to keep my own experience as a stu� dent in mind and to write the kind of book I liked to read. That goal determined the choice of topics, their order, and the method of presentation. The organization of the book is intended to encourage independent study. Accordingly, I have made every effort to keep the material self-contained, to develop the mathematics as it is needed, and to present new material by building incrementally on preceding material. In organizing the text, I have taken care to give explicit cross references, to show the intermediate steps in calculations, and to give many examples. Provided they are within the mathematical scope of this book, I have preferred elegant mathematical treatments over more ad hoc ones, not only for aesthetic reasons, but because they are often more profound and indicate connections to other branches of physics.

One at a time, each sense is examined, partnering those eye-popping pictures with simple declaratory text. First, our eyes: they see the world around us, including patterns, colors, and shapes. Second, our ears hear loud sounds and quiet sounds. Third, our hands, feet, and skin feel rough, smooth, wet, cold, grainy, and warm. Fourth, our noses smell fragrant, pungent, ripe, and rotten. And finally, our tongues taste sweet, sour, and salty, and can distinguish between flavors. After these great examples of visual learning, readers are given the opportunity to choose which senses they use in different settings. For example: 'Can you say which senses we use when we . . . take a walk outside?' <strong>This is just one entry in the Jane Brocket's Clever Concepts series, all of which share the same snazzy appeal.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Brocket's latest in the Clever Concepts series uses photographs to explore the five senses.<br> The text explains the five senses in a way even the youngest of readers can understand, and it's paired with simple photos that highlight just what the text is mentioning but that are also full of patterns, shapes, colors and textures. They highlight everyday sights and objects with new angles and perspectives that will have kids looking around on walks in the neighborhood&#x2015;plants, architectural details, rocks and flowers are prominently featured. We use our eyes to see colors, read books, discern patterns; our ears to hear; we feel with our hands, our feet, our skin; our noses smell things that are nice but also things that are not so nice&#x2015;garbage, for instance. 'We use our tongues to taste.... // We can taste many flavors. Juicy cherries, spicy chilies, and jammy cookies. / Oily, salty fish. Fluffy vanilla frosting. Cool, minty toothpaste.' Brocket concludes by pointing out that we often use more than one sense at a time&#x2015;eating a crunchy pretzel twist uses all five senses at once&#x2015;and two pages of photo collages challenge readers to name which senses are in use in each.<br> <strong>Teachers and parents eager for their children to experience the world in a different way will be thrilled.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Once again, Brocket has created a rich, sensory treat that young children will thoroughly enjoy. Using her signature photography brimming with color and detail, she invites her audience to use all five senses to soak up the world around them. Thanks to spectacular tight shots, youngsters can almost hear the splashing of a waterfall, smell freshly baked bread, taste the crunchy edges of a fried egg, and feel the velvety covering of a budding flower. The text is minimal but packs a descriptive punch, and it's presented in a fun font against neutral, textured rectangles. The concluding spread asks readers to name all five senses again and think about which ones they're using in that moment. <strong>This selection would be a wonderful tool for heightening a child's awareness of all the sensory experiences afforded by an outing to the park or any other venue or for a fun sensory-based scavenger hunt at home on a dreary day.

The book is addressed to students on various levels, to mathematicians, scientists, engineers. It does not pretend to make the subject easy by glossing over difficulties, but rather tries to help the genuinely interested reader by throwing light on the interconnections and purposes of the whole. Instead of obstructing the access to the wealth of facts by lengthy discussions of a fundamental nature we have sometimes postponed such discussions to appendices in the various chapters. Numerous examples and problems are given at the end of various chapters. Some are challenging, some are even difficult; most of them supplement the material in the text.</p><p><p><strong><em>Bi</em></strong><strong><em>ography of Richard Courant</em></strong></p> <p>Richard Courant was born in 1888 in a small town of what is now Poland, and died in New Rochelle, N.Y. in 1972. He received his doctorate from the legendary David Hilbert in G�ttingen, where later he founded and directed its famed mathematics Institute, a Mecca for mathematicians in the twenties. In 1933 the Nazi government dismissed Courant for being Jewish, and he emigrated to the United States. He found, in New York, what he called "a reservoir of talent" to be tapped. He built, at New York University, a new mathematical Sciences Institute that shares the philosophy of its illustrious predecessor and rivals it in worldwide influence. <br>For Courant mathematics was an adventure, with applications forming a vital part. This spirit is reflected in his books, in particular in his influential calculus text, revised in collaboration with his brilliant younger colleague, Fritz John. <br><em>(P.D. Lax)</em><br><br><strong><em>Biography of Fritz John<br></em></strong><br>Fritz John was born on June 14, 1910, in Berlin. After his school years in Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland), he studied in G�ttingen and received his doctorate in 1933, just when the Nazi regime came to power. As he was half-Jewish and his bride Aryan, he had to flee Germany in 1934. After a year in Cambridge, UK, he accepted a position at the University of Kentucky, and in 1946 joined Courant, Friedrichs and Stoker in building up New York University the institute that later became the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He remained there until his death in New Rochelle on February 10, 1994. <br>John's research and the books he wrote had a strong impact on the development of many fields of mathematics, foremost in partial differential equations. He also worked on Radon transforms, illposed problems, convex geometry, numerical analysis, elasticity theory. In connection with his work in latter field, he and Nirenberg introduced the space of the BMO-functions (bounded mean oscillations). Fritz John's work exemplifies the unity of mathematics as well as its elegance and its beauty. <br><em>(J. Moser)</em></p><p>From the reviews: "Volume 1 covers a basic course in real analysis of one variable and Fourier series. It is well-illustrated, well-motivated and very well-provided with a multitude of unusually useful and accessible exercises. [...]It is the best text known to the reviewer for anyone trying to make an analysis course less abstract." --The Mathematical Gazette</p></p><h2>Ukrainian Nationalism: Politics, Ideology, and Literature, 1929-1956</h2><p>Both celebrated and condemned, Ukrainian nationalism is one of the most controversial and vibrant topics in contemporary discussions of Eastern Europe. Perhaps today there is no more divisive and heatedly argued topic in Eastern European studies than the activities in the 1930s and 1940s of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN).<br> &nbsp;<br> This book examines the legacy of the OUN and is the first to consider the movement&#x2019;s literature alongside its politics and ideology. It argues that nationalism&#x2019;s mythmaking, best expressed in its literature, played an important role. In the interwar period seven major writers developed the narrative structures that gave nationalism much of its appeal. For the first time, the remarkable impact of their work is recognized.</p><p><b>Myroslav Shkandrij</b> is professor of Slavic studies at the University of Manitoba.

He places the ideological tenets and historical actions of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists within a broader socio-historical and cultural frame, a refreshingly original approach that allows us to see contestation not only within Ukrainian nationalism but also within the OUN itself.&#x201d;&#x2014;Rory Finnin, University of Cambridge (Rory Finnin)</p><h2>Trask&#39;s Historical Linguistics</h2><p>This book is an introduction to historical linguistics - the study of language change over time.

The book is also fun to read because the authors' passion and pleasure in the topic are evident from start to finish.

It draws from fields as diverse as anthropology to molecular biology in order to illustrate the vast landscape of an organism in all its complexity.

This unorthodox biography focuses on Burke's thoughts, responses, and actions to the great events and debates surrounding Britain's tumultuous relationships with her three colonies&#x2014;America, Ireland, and India&#x2014;and archrival France.<br><br>"In bringing Burke to our attention, Mr. O'Brien has brought back a lost treasure. <i>The Great Melody</i> is a brilliant work of narrative sweep and analytical depth. Conor Cruise O'Brien on Edmund Burke is a literary gift to political thought."&#x2014;John Patrick Diggins, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Serious readers of history are in for a treat: a book by the greatest living Irishman on the greatest Irishman who ever lived. . . . O'Brien's study is not merely a reconstruction of a fascinating man and period. It is also a tract for the times. . . . I cannot remember another time when I finished a book of more than 600 pages wishing it were longer."&#x2014;Paul Johnson, <i>The Independent</i><br><br>"<i>The Great Melody</i> combines superb biography and fascinating history with a profound understanding of political philosophy."&#x2014;Former President Richard Nixon<br></p><p><b>Conor Cruise O'Brien</b> (1917-2008) was a leading Irish intellectual of his generation and had&nbsp;a distinguished career in public life as a diplomat, politician, government minister, writer, newspaper editor, critic, and scholar.

Written for readers with a basic knowledge of set theory, general topology, and vector spaces, the book includes an abundance of carefully chosen illustrative examples and excellent exercises at the end of each chapter.<br>Beginning with a chapter of preliminaries on set theory and topology, Dr. Edwards then presents detailed, in-depth discussions of vector spaces and topological vector spaces, the Hahn-Banach theorem (including applications to potential theory, approximation theory, game theory, and other fields) and fixed-point theorems. Subsequent chapters focus on topological duals of certain spaces: radon measures, distribution and linear partial differential equations, open mapping and closed graph theorems, boundedness principles, duality theory, the theory of compact operators and the Krein-Milman theorem and its applications to commutative harmonic analysis. <br>Clearly and concisely written, Dr. Edwards's book offers rewarding reading to mathematicians and physicists with an interest in the important field of functional analysis. Because of the broad scope of its coverage, this volume will be especially valuable to the reader with a basic knowledge of functional analysis who wishes to learn about parts of the subject other than his own specialties. A comprehensive 32-page bibliography supplies a rich source of references to the basic literature.</p><p></p><h2>College Reading: The Science and Strategies of Expert Readers</h2><p>COLLEGE READING: THE SCIENCE AND STRATEGIES OF EXPERT READERS approaches reading from a thinking skills perspective by explaining how we think, learn, and read. This expert group of authors credibly incorporates widely proven brain research and learning theory into a user-friendly dynamic reading textbook aimed at diverse learners. The bridge from the scientific research to the classroom is carefully crafted so that not only will students learn to read more efficiently, but they will also learn how to learn more efficiently. By explaining the brain science of reading, COLLEGE READING empowers students with the knowledge that they can change their brain into a more effective reading brain. COLLEGE READING teaches students how to read by providing interactive learning and reading opportunities--Making Connections, Brain Connections, Activities, Practice with a Reading Passage, Post Test, and Brain Strength Options--so that students are discovering, understanding, and remembering essential reading skills they can apply to their future coursework.

Normally, I choose my books feeling like they will be ok, but not that they will necessarily change my students' lives. I really feel like this book offers so much useful, understandable information, that students will feel like they are getting in on the "secret" of how to succeed in college. It will take some work, but because the activities are engaging and personal, I believe students will enjoy the process."<br><br>"I am thrilled that a college reading textbook finally has paired how to learn with the process of reading. It incorporates teaching the student about the brain and how it functions and then applies that to the process of reading. This is something I have tried to do for over twenty years. It's gratifying to find a text that does it so well."<br><br>"This text bothers to explain the reasoning (the science) behind how students can become more effective readers while continually assuring students that they have the power to improve their reading based on that reasoning. Most other texts focus on WHY students should become more effective readers and basically issue prescriptions for improved reading without rational."<br><br>"In my classes I discuss building dendrites, but this book actually practices this theory in every chapter. I really like the section at the beginning of each chapter where it asks students to draw their dendrites and then at the end of the chapter to now draw their dendrites. This book truly practices and reinforces brain theory. So many students do not have a clear understanding as to how they learn and how important it is to their reading and comprehension. This is truly innovative and relevant to present day college students."</p><h2>A Dictionary of Theatre Anthropology: The Secret Art of the Performer</h2><p>First Published in 2005.

The Regulator Rebellion of 1766-71 pitted thousands of farmers, many of them religious radicals inspired by the Great Awakening, against political and economic elites who opposed the Regulators' proposed reforms. The conflict culminated on May 16, 1771, when a colonial militia defeated more than 2,000 armed farmers in a pitched battle near Hillsborough. At least 6,000 Regulators and sympathizers were forced to swear their allegiance to the government as the victorious troops undertook a punitive march through Regulator settlements. Seven farmers were hanged.<br><br>Using sources that include diaries, church minutes, legal papers, and the richly detailed accounts of the Regulators themselves, Marjoleine Kars delves deeply into the world and ideology of free rural colonists.

According to statistics from the U.S. Health and Human Resources Department, one third of American children are overweight or obese due to our lifestyle choices. The number one concern that parents bring up to pediatricians is keeping kids fit, and half of all children are not physically active enough for the development of a healthy cardiovascular system. In this age of electronic media, where we become watchers instead of doers, we are simply forgetting the many wonderful ways of playing and exercising together.<br><br>&#x2018;Tweens in particular are susceptible to overweight issues; the drop-out rate of structured sports programs is highest at this age group.<i>303 Tween-Approved Exercises and Active Games</i> is written specifically for kids ages 9-12 years old. Kimberley Wechsler, a specialist in Kid&#x2019;s Fitness, took into account the fundamental attributes of being a child while developing these exercises. Children have specific physiologic differences that make them unique. They grow, mature, and develop skills at different ages, so what may be skill appropriate for one child could be harmful for another child. These exercises reflect the emotional, social, physical level of this age group.<br><br>Children of this age group are now at the skill level in which physical challenges like mind, body, meditation, balance, muscle strengthening, and sport performance building exercises become very important. Sports skills and drills can now be developed, and competition is highlighted and welcomed within this age group. Kids at this age like to show off their talents so it is important for teachers and parents to observe and provide positive feedback on all of their accomplishments. At this age, tweens want to belong to a sport, group, or identify with a sport celebrity to begin to define who they are and what their likes are; friends also tend to become more of an influence than parents at this age. Bad behavior patterns and peer pressure have now developed--making it more difficult to change current patterns--but it can be done. <i>303 Tween-Approved Exercises and Active Games</i> can help tweens build confidence in high-pressure situations and build their social skills through playing team sports.<br><br>Kids within this age group are now experienced with the basic fundamentals of fitness and prefer games, sports, and exercises that are more challenging and competitive. They are physically, intellectually, emotionally becoming young adults. They can think abstractly, make decisions, understand rules and challenge rules; they are more mature then kids 6-8 years old, and their games and physical challenges must reflect these characteristics. They have formed a sense of self-identity and they are more independent, yet their friends are very important to them. Many of the exercises are written to include their friends--they can challenge their friends or work as a team with their friends.<br><br>Tweens have a preferred Fitness Personality--a style of fitness that suits their likes. Therefore, they can choose their style of exercises from 303 physical challenges. They can choose to do them independently, with a friend, or with a group of friends. They can choose from many styles of fitness in <i>303 Tween-Approved Exercises and Active Games</i>: mind/body, military style fitness, sports performance, functional resistance, strength training, plyometric style, outdoor challenges, circuit/interval/obstacle course training. <i>303 Tween-Approved Exercises and Active Games</i> allows &#x2018;tweens to choose the type of exercise. By giving each challenge/game a point value, &#x2018;tweens can freely choose their exercises and will receive a complete workout each and every time.

His most notable works include &#34;White Fang&#34;, &#34;The Call of the Wild&#34;, and &#34;The Sea-Wolf.&#34; He was born in San Francisco, California.Ignore the package's shouts about this being an "audio movie" and a "masterpiece" with "spectacular sound effects." Listeners will find this overwrought version of one of London's survival tales a worthwhile listen, though not as life-changing as the publisher seems to hope. Perhaps if Ziggurat had concentrated more closely on the story instead of music and effects, this listen might have held the value it strives too hard to achieve. This recording, however, would probably be fine fare for young people new to audio theater and those studying London in school.

Yet it was there, at the end of World War I, at a new university in this commercial center, that a trio of twentieth-century pioneers in the humanities emerged. Working side by side, Aby Warburg, Ernst Cassirer, and Erwin Panofsky developed new avenues in art history, cultural history, and philosophy, changing the course of cultural and intellectual history in Weimar Germany and throughout the world.<br> <br> In <i>Dreamland of Humanists</i>, Emily J. Levine considers not just these men, but the historical significance of the time and place where their ideas took form. Shedding light on the origins of their work on the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, Levine clarifies the social, political, and economic pressures faced by German-Jewish scholars on the periphery of Germany&#x2019;s intellectual world. By examining the role that context plays in our analysis of ideas, Levine confirms that great ideas&#x2014;like great intellectuals&#x2014;must come from somewhere.</p> <p> </p></p><p><b>Emily J. Levine</b> is assistant professor of history at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Born in New York City, she lives in Durham, North Carolina.&nbsp;&#x201c;Insightful, interesting, and sophisticated,&nbsp;<i>Dreamland of Humanists</i>&nbsp;not only contributes to our individual and collective knowledge of the Warburg school but it sheds new light on the intellectual and political struggles and ultimately tragic fate of Weimar culture as a whole. I would go so far as to state that this is a work that I have been waiting for.&#x201d; (Steven E. Aschheim, author of Beyond the Border: The German-Jewish Legacy Abroad)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Dreamland of Humanists</i> is a deeply researched, well-structured, and elegantly written work of history that brings to life the city of Hamburg, a place that, thanks to its unique Hanseatic economic and political traditions, served as a welcome home for the Warburg Library and the three German Jewish intellectuals most closely associated with its name. Levine should be commended.&#x201d; (Peter E. Gordon <i>author of Continental Divide: Heidegger, Cassirer, Davos</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;From its inception in the early 1900s to its relocation to London in 1933, the Warburg Library in Hamburg was a symbol of holistic cultural study and humanistic learning, while the men most closely associated with the Library&#x2014;Aby Warburg, Erwin Panofsky, and Ernst Cassirer&#x2014;were vital to the symbolic turn that marked so much of twentieth-century thought.&nbsp;Emily Levine skillfully weaves together three men, a library, and a city in this compelling study of a crucial moment in modern intellectual history.&nbsp;She significantly enhances our understanding of the ideas and the shared urban and institutional context of these pivotal thinkers, while recasting Weimar culture in light of a shifting focus from the capital to Germany&#x2019;s &#x2018;second&#x2019; city.&#x201d;<br> (Warren Breckman, author of Adventures of the Symbolic: Postmarxism and Radical Democracy)<br><br>"A thoughtful and massively researched book. . .&nbsp; . One learns a lot and is left with a lot to ponder." (<i>Key Reporter</i>)<br><br>"In arguing for the importance of place and social setting in the formation of ideas, Levine crosses as many scholarly disciplines as Aby Warbug's Library of the Science of Culture did in its heyday. . . . Levine shows how crucially time, place, and people can affect what we finally study and ponder; but in the end, if we are lucky, we all make our own Dreamland of Humanists with the materials at hand." (<i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;If there is any example of an intellectual history with its feet on the ground, then it would be Levine&#x2019;s thoroughly researched and beautifully told story of the Warburg library. More than a book about a place, an institution, and a handful of intellectuals, <i>Dreamland of </i><i>Humanists </i>is an unparalleled geography of twentieth century intellectual life, and a key to its countless codes and mysteries.&#x201d; (<i>German History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Levine gets it right. Her accounts are characterized by an impressive intellectual reach and stupendous scholarship. . . . Levine offers more than a contribution to the cultural and intellectual history of twentieth-century Germany, the Weimar period, or the development of the disciplines of art history, cultural history, and philosophy. <i>Dreamland of Humanists </i>is an examination into the principal conditions under which great ideas can thrive&#x2014;anywhere in the world.&#x201d; (<i>German Studies Review</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Levine&#x2019;s book succeeds very well, too, in carrying out another mission, and that is to understand exactly what difference the &#x2018;Jewishness&#x2019; of the three protagonists made in their lives and ideas. . . . Never pushing the case too hard, Levine shows that all these figures lived and worked keenly aware of the cultural prejudices around them, trying, in various ways, to transcend them. Levine deserves much credit for having given us new insight into these figures by setting them firmly into the loamy soil of Hamburg. . . . This is a fine book, and I hope it will provoke the writing of more studies of liberal intellectuals and their hometowns.&#x201d;</p> (Suzanne Marchand <i>Journal of Modern History</i>)<br><br><p>&#x201c;During the decades surrounding the turn of the twentieth century, a small coterie of intellectual and cultural figures succeeded into transforming Hamburg, however briefly, into one of the cultural capitals of Europe. Levine&#x2019;s <i>Dreamland of Humanists</i> is an intellectual history of this important, and underappreciated, place and time. . . . Levine has contributed a major volume to the project of reestablishing the intellectual significance of Warburg, Cassirer, and Panofsky for twentieth century humanist thought, and the cultural transformation of the city that sustained them.&#x201d;</p> (<i>MAKE Literary Magazine</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It is a German history, Jewish history, cultural history, and intellectual history refreshingly unlike most of the work on the Warburg Institute. Levine, with unrivalled perspicacity, goes beyond her precursors who were wary of venturing beyond simply stating that the progenitors of the Warburgian project were mainly Jews. With rare exception, Jewishness has been viewed primarily as one among many elements in the combustible mix that pushed the Hamburg School out of Germany after the Nazi rise to power. Levine persuasively argues that Aby Warburg and his cohort, who came together over their historical interest in symbols and myths, must be understood by considering not only the fact of their Jewish origins and the ways they were perceived as Jews.&#x201d; (<i>Michael Berkowitz, German Quarterly</i>)</p><h2>Materialism</h2><p><b>A brilliant introduction to the philosophical concept of materialism and its relevance to contemporary science and culture</b><br><br> In this eye-opening, intellectually stimulating appreciation of a fascinating school of philosophy, Terry Eagleton makes a powerful argument that materialism is at the center of today&#x2019;s important scientific and cultural as well as philosophical debates. The author reveals entirely fresh ways of considering the values and beliefs of three very different materialists&#x2014;Marx, Nietzsche, and Wittgenstein&#x2014;drawing striking comparisons between their philosophies while reflecting on a wide array of topics, from ideology and history to language, ethics, and the aesthetic.

They would do well to take to heart Terry Eagleton&#x2019;s new, eminently commonsensical elaboration of the concept of materialism. Eagleton partners up with Marx, Nietzsche, Freud and Wittgenstein to awaken us to the materialism we already live, to which we have always already committed, in our embodied practices. We thereby come to see how the natural history of our forms of life implicates us in a creaturely solidarity with one another, the elaboration of which constitutes the conflict-ridden realm of politics. Eagleton&#x2019;s uncommonly luminous prose holds out the promise that a genuinely common life &#x2013; call it ordinary life &#x2013; for creatures such as us might yet be achievable."&#x2014;Eric L.

Zinn, Jr.</h2><p>From Knowledge to Beatitude is a collection of original essays on the intersection between Christian theology and spiritual life primarily in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, especially in the Parisian School of St. Victor, which honors the influential work of Grover A. Zinn, Jr. Written by distinguished scholars from various fields of medieval studies, these essays range from the study of the exegetical school of twelfth-century St. Victor and medieval glossed Bibles to the medieval cultural reception of women visionaries, preachers, and crusaders. Although focused on St. Victor, they provide analyses of Christian themes up to the modern period. A common thread is Zinn&#x2019;s careful attention to the connections between medieval spirituality and biblical studies, the origin of these ideas, and their lasting influence in Christian culture. The essays take us from Hugh of St. Victor&#x2019;s foundation&#x2015;material culture&#x2015;to the &#x201c;beatitude&#x201d; of a wider understanding of Victorine culture and its lasting legacy.<p></p><p>This volume is a fitting tribute to a generous scholar, teacher, and mentor.

The organization of the volume makes sense, starting with&nbsp; essays concerned with the 'material culture' of St. Victor, through explorations of the twelfth-century community's <i>mentalit�</i>, to reception-history or thematic studies linked to elements Victorine spirituality and theology. Matter's closing essay, a graceful tribute to her undergraduate mentor, should be commended to undergraduates as an archetypal artifact of the life of the mind." (Deborah L. Goodwin, Gustavus Adolphus College)<br><br>&#x201c;The essays, written by medieval scholars from various fields, are models for research methodologies in the fields of medieval or art history, exegesis, theology, or philosophy. . . . This collection does an excellent job of demonstrating how past and present exegetists explain and interpret religious writings and the Bible.&#x201d; (<i>Teaching History</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a wide-ranging and impressive collection of essays by a number of important scholars in the field of Victorine, twelfth century and early medieval thought. . . . The whole of the volume is a little like creation for Hugh of St. Victor, &#x2018;a table heaped high with gifts.&#x2019; This collection, like Zinn&#x2019;s own work of scholarship informed by joy and appreciation for the period, is set out as a table of delights.&#x201d; (<i>H-France Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Editors E. Ann Matter and Lesley Smith have assembled seventeen consistently excellent essays especially on the Victorines and other twelfth-century writers, from authors who studied with Zinn at Oberlin College and/or collaborate with him now on such projects as the multivolume <i>Victorine Texts in Translation</i> from Brepols. Further, they have also supplied exceptional editorial features of scholarly substance, literary grace and sheer generosity. The volume thus matches Zinn&#x2019;s own patterns of thorough, careful, and generous teaching and writing in several ways.&#x201d; (<i>Religion and Literature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Grover Zinn, Jr. has played a key role in promoting a renewal of interest in the intellectual and religious culture of St. Victor, at least within the English-speaking world. The publication of this volume is thus a fitting tribute to his achievement. . . . [It] offers a potpourri of essays on the great internal diversity of Victorine spiritual culture, and much else besides.&#x201d; (<i>Parergon</i>)<br><br>"<i>From Knowledge to Beatitude</i> serves a need and fills an important gap in the Victorine tradition, the history of medieval exegesis, and medieval studies. The volume also honors the contributions of Grover Zinn, an important medieval scholar and teacher. It serves as a model for doing research and generalizing in the field of medieval studies and demonstrates how the last generation and the current generation of medieval scholars have plowed through difficult primary and secondary sources to make the medieval traditions clear." (Philip Krey, Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia)<br><br>&#x201c;In an original and touching final piece, E. Ann Matter evokes a wintry night in Oberlin, Ohio, listening to a Bach cantata she had brought to share with Zinn and his Medieval Christianity class. Here she compares the spirituality of that cantata to Richard of St. Victor&#x2019;s <i>Mystical Ark</i>, which Zinn was then translating. That a decades-old experience should inspire such quality scholarship is testament to Zinn&#x2019;s intellectual generosity and immense didactic skill.

The cars we drive today follow the same underlying design principles as the Model Ts of a hundred years ago and the tail-finned sedans of fifty years ago. In the twenty-first century, cars are still made for twentieth-century purposes. They are inefficient for providing personal mobility within cities -- where most of the world's people now live. In this pathbreaking book, William Mitchell and two industry experts reimagine the automobile, describing vehicles of the near future that are green, smart, connected, and fun to drive. They roll out four big ideas that will make this both feasible and timely.</p><p>The fundamental reinvention of the automobile won't be easy, but it is an urgent necessity -- to make urban mobility more convenient and sustainable, to make cities more livable, and to help bring the automobile industry out of crisis.</p></p><p><p>William J. Mitchell was the Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr., Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences and directed the Smart Cities research group at MIT's Media Lab. Christopher Borroni-Bird is GM's Director of Advanced Technology Vehicle Concepts. Lawrence D. Burns advises companies, governments, and universities on transportation, energy, and communications systems and technology. He was Vice President of Research and Development at General Motors from 1998 to 2009.</p><p>The content is intelligent, well laid out, entertaining, understandable, and approachable...Often, works about the future of the automobile industry are just tools to express idealistic beliefs or anti-industry sentiments. This book is refreshing because the authors understand the whole package in terms of current problems, and their solutions, and succinctly present a glimpse of a future (and a present) that people can feel good about. </p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>In this book, William Mitchell, perhaps the greatest urban theorist and designer of the Information Age, provides a concrete alternative to the unsustainable model of urban transportation based on the traditional automobile, and paves the way for the transformation of the automobile industry as a whole. In this time of crisis <i>Reinventing the Automobile</i> is mandatory reading, besides researchers and students, for planners, industrialists, and governments searching for a way out for the car of the industrial era.</p> (Manuel Castells, Professor Emeritus of City Planning, University of California, Berkeley)<br><br><p>Our American auto industry is at a perilous crossroads - it can adhere to the 'old ways' and perish or it can leapfrog the competition, reinvent itself, and lead the automotive world into the 21st century. Many of the ideas set forth in this book just might serve as a blueprint for this much-needed and important change of direction. Who better to lead the way than our geek brethren from MIT?</p> (Tom &amp; Ray Magliozzi, aka "Click and Clack," Hosts of Car Talk)<br><br><p>We are at the threshold of a new era of urban transport. <i>Reinventing the Automobile</i> offers a breathtaking vista of the opportunities ahead. Mitchell, Borroni-Bird, and Burns combine their great engineering expertise, design skills, and practical experience to create a dazzling vision of a new urban transport system to support healthy, productive, safe, and environmentally sustainable cities in the 21st century. The book is consistently exciting, a wonderful chance to peer over the shoulders of masters as they sort through the complex terrain of energy systems, urban lifestyles, digital connectivity, and cutting-edge automotive engineering. This book will fascinate and inspire not only specialists in transport and engineering, but everybody interested in the new age of sustainable development.</p> (Jeffrey D. Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. Special Advisor to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon)<br><br><p>Finally, a book that addresses the problems of carbon emissions, sustainability, transportation, city planning, and traffic, by authors who understand what the automobile industry does not -- that these issues are all interconnected and part of the same picture. This book has a great deal to offer to anyone who is interested in the green movement in architecture, in city planning, in traffic problems, in pollution, and in the challenge of making our planet more humane.</p> (Frank Gehry)<br><br><p>Mitchell, Borroni-Bird, and Burns have created a blueprint for sustainable urban mobility. <i>Reinventing the Automobile</i> will fundamentally change the way we approach transportation design. Every car company should take note: evolve or face increasing irrelevance.</p> (David Kelley, Founder and Chairman, IDEO, and Professor, Stanford University)<br><br><p>It isn't technological barriers so much as closed minds that are holding back the necessary evolution of the automobile; using calm and devastatingly inarguable logic, this is a virtual step-by-step manual that deploys an original idea on every page to show exactly how it can and should be achieved. If you care about cars, read this book: it opens your mind and lets the future in.</p> (Bruce McCall, artist and writer <i><i>The New Yorker</i></i>)<br><br><p>Visionary in its totality, it is also soberly realistic.</p> (Peter D. Norton <i><i>Metascience</i></i>)<br><br><p>Presents a fascinating and challenging model of technological possibilities.</p> (Martin Wachs <i><i>Issues in Science and Technology</i></i>)</p><h2>Empire and Revolution: The Political Life of Edmund Burke</h2><p><p><b>A major new account of one of the leading philosopher-statesmen of the eighteenth century</b></p><p>Edmund Burke (1730&#x2013;97) lived during one of the most extraordinary periods of world history. He grappled with the significance of the British Empire in India, fought for reconciliation with the American colonies, and was a vocal critic of national policy during three European wars. He also advocated reform in Britain and became a central protagonist in the great debate on the French Revolution. Drawing on the complete range of printed and manuscript sources, <i>Empire and Revolution</i> offers a vivid reconstruction of the major concerns of this outstanding statesman, orator, and philosopher. In restoring Burke to his original political and intellectual context, this book overturns the conventional picture of a partisan of tradition against progress and presents a multifaceted portrait of one of the most captivating figures in eighteenth-century life and thought. A boldly ambitious work of scholarship, this book challenges us to rethink the legacy of Burke and the turbulent era in which he played so pivotal a role.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Empire and Revolution</i> is a remarkable achievement. Richard Bourke combines an astonishing mastery of detail with unfailingly good judgment and clarity of argument. He does justice to every facet of Burke's extraordinarily rich intellectual and political life, and to the global reach of Burke's attention and efforts. This is a work to savor."<b>--Jennifer Pitts, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"Bridging the gap between political practice and political thought has presented a major conundrum for intellectual historians, most especially for students of Edmund Burke. With massive erudition, comprehensive scholarship, and methodological subtlety, Richard Bourke triumphantly solves this problem by scrupulously tracking the principles informing Burke's interventions across his entire political life. <i>Empire and Revolution</i> is quite simply the best book on Burke ever written: all future work on Burke must start from here."<b>--David Armitage, Harvard University</b></p><p>"<i>Empire and Revolution</i> is a monumental achievement. Bourke has at once given us a sensitive reading of Edmund Burke's political commitments and a bracing portrait of the later-eighteenth-century British Empire. This elegant and powerful book not only forces us to rethink Burke's politics, it compels us to rethink his age and our relationship to it."<b>--Steven Pincus, Yale University</b></p><p>"Our understanding of Burke's thought as both statesman and philosopher, engaged in the many problems of his revolutionary times, is from this moment both deepened and broadened beyond measure."<b>--J.G.A. Pocock, Johns Hopkins University</b></p><p>"<i>Empire and Revolution</i> is the best book on Edmund Burke available. It takes a scholar of singular learning to tackle a figure like Burke, and Richard Bourke is exactly that person. His writing is clear, his scholarship impeccable, and his mastery of eighteenth-century history self-evident. This is a brilliant book and a model for intellectual historians."<b>--Richard Whatmore, University of St Andrews</b></p><p>"An extremely impressive piece of work."<b>--Mark Philp, author of <i>Reforming Ideas in Britain: Politics and Language in the Shadow of the French Revolution, 1789-1815</i></b></p><b>Richard Bourke</b> is professor of the history of political thought and a fellow of King's College, University of Cambridge.</p><h2>Cymbeline (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p><b><i>&#x201c;Golden lads and girls all must, </i></b><br><b><i>As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.&#x201d;</i></b><br><b>&#x2014;Cymbeline</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>Eminent Shakespearean scholars Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen provide a fresh new edition of this classic tragedy in which nothing is as it seems.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>THIS VOLUME ALSO INCLUDES MORE THAN A HUNDRED PAGES OF EXCLUSIVE FEATURES:</b><br>&nbsp;<br>� an original Introduction to <i>Cymbeline</i><br>� incisive scene-by-scene synopsis and analysis with vital facts about the work<br>� commentary on past and current productions based on interviews with leading directors, actors, and designers<br>� photographs of key RSC productions<br>� an overview of Shakespeare&#x2019;s theatrical career and chronology of his plays<br>&nbsp;<br>Ideal for students, theater professionals, and general readers, these modern and accessible editions from the Royal Shakespeare Company set a new standard in Shakespearean literature for the twenty-first century.</p><p><b>William Shakespeare</b>&nbsp;(1564&#x2013;1616)&nbsp;was a&nbsp;poet,&nbsp;playwright, and actor who is widely regarded as one of the most&nbsp;influential writers in the history of the English language.

But when leaders with otherwise strong track records suddenly begin making poor decisions-as seen in the recent corporate scandals that rocked the business world-the impact can be widespread. In <i>The Stress Effect</i>, leadership expert Henry L. Thompson argues that stress is often the real culprit behind this leadership failure: when leaders' stress levels become sufficiently elevated-whether in the boardroom or on the front line of a manufacturing process-their ability to effectively use their emotional intelligence and cognitive ability in tandem to make wise decisions is significantly impaired. Until now, experts have argued that increasing your emotional intelligence will help you cope with and manage stress. This book suggests that stress actually <i>blocks</i> access to your emotional intelligence as well as your cognitive ability, two critical components in the decision-making process. This book<br> </p> <ul> <li>Shows how stress adversely affects the performance of even the most savvy leaders</li> <li>Reveals the truth about one of the prime factors behind the current failure of leadership</li> <li>Offers a solid prescription for building a "stress resilient system" and arms leaders with best practices for managing specific stressors that take the biggest toll on decision making</li> <li>Is written by an award-winning organizational psychologist and leadership consultant whose clients include a roster of Fortune 500 companies</li> </ul> <p>A groundbreaking and insightful resource for leaders, <i>The Stress Effect</i> reopens the dialogue on stress, its effect on decision making, and what to do about it.</p></p><p><p>Praise for The Stress Effect</p> <p>"Henry (Dick) Thompson tackles the secrets of effective leadership and decision making&#x2015;and does so with admirable insight, erudition, and authority.

Every leader can grow personally and</p> <p>professionally from the information it presents on how stress impacts the quality and timeliness of decisions.

Thompson offers original ideas and insights, honed through his rich experiences on the battlefield and as a consultant to C-level executives, which will season your decision-making judgment. Simply put, after reading The Stress Effect, you will be a much better leader who gets much better results."<br> &#x2015;Bill Treasurer, CEO, Giant Leap Consulting</p>The ability to make sound and timely decisions is the mark of a good leader. However, when leaders with otherwise strong track records suddenly begin making poor decisions&#x2014;as seen in the recent corporate scandals that rocked the business world&#x2014;the impact can be devastating. <br> <br> <p>In The Stress Effect, leadership expert Henry L. Thompson reveals that stress is often the culprit behind leadership failure. When leaders' stress levels become sufficiently elevated, their ability</p> <p>to call on both emotional and cognitive intelli-gences to make wise decisions is dramatically impaired. Experts have argued that increasing your emotional intelligence will help you cope with and manage stress. But Thompson clearly shows that stress actually blocks access to</p> <p>your emotional intelligence as well as your</p> <p>cognitive intelligence, two critical components</p> <p>in the decision-making process.</p> <p>Drawing on examples from Green Berets on the battlefield to top-level executives in the boardroom, The Stress Effect explains how to make good decisions under extreme stress. The book also demonstrates how we can all develop a "stress resilient system" by focusing on three key areas&#x2014;stress management capacity, cognitive resilience, and stress resilient emotional intelligence. Thompson also offers an innovative and solid prescription for managing specific stressors that have proven to take the biggest toll on the decision-making process.</p> <p>The Stress Effect offers critical guidance for any leader under pressure, for those charged with selecting high-potential leaders, or for anyone who wants to understand how to manage stress in their own lives.</p></p><h2>The William Desmond Reader</h2><p><i>Career-spanning selections from the writings of William Desmond.</i><br>Known especially for his original system of metaphysics in a trilogy of books published between 1995 and 2008, and for his scholarship on Hegel, William Desmond has left his mark on the philosophy of religion, ethics, and aesthetics.&nbsp;<i>The William Desmond Reader</i>&nbsp;provides for the first time in a single book a point of entry into his original and constructive philosophy, including carefully chosen selections of his works that introduce the key ideas, perspectives, and contributions of his philosophy as a whole.

The training kit is based on the &#x201c;Thirty Core Competencies&#x201d; as outlined in the book The Connecting Church, also by Pastor Randy Frazee. These thirty core competencies help churches know when they are making progress in guiding their members toward Christ-likeness. Each of the four sessions contains components such as video, lecture, leader-led discussion, large group discussion, and small group discussion. Individuals answer 120 questions about their Christian beliefs, practices, and virtues. Three friends also assess them in the virtues area. Using the results, individuals identify areas in which they would like to grow during the upcoming year. The resource guide provides plans to help realize the growth such as reading books, memorizing Scripture, attending a seminar, being mentored by a spiritual director, or engaging in a new spiritual discipline. The Christian Life Profile journey is experienced in a small group community that seeks to encourage, pray, and hold each other accountable for progress. The goal is to take the profile again, one year later, to monitor the journey. The complete kit includes a four-session Training Guide, a copy of The Christian Life Profile Assessment Tool, and a DVD to assist in training. The Christian Life Profile Assessment Tool and Training Guide are also available separately.</p></p><p><p>Randy Frazee is the senior minister at Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas.

Many different types of service call themselves a portal and it is difficult for end users to differentiate between these and understand what functionality is available. The library world has a particular concern in addressing this problem.

Hendel tells how Luther's criticisms of traditional figurative accounts of Genesis undermined the Catholic Church; how Galileo made the radical argument that the cosmology of Genesis wasn't scientific evidence; and how Spinoza made the equally radical argument that the scientific method should be applied to Genesis itself. Indeed, Hendel shows how many high points of Western thought and art have taken the form of encounters with Genesis--from Paul and Augustine to Darwin, Emily Dickinson, and Kafka.</p><br><p> From debates about slavery, gender, and sexuality to the struggles over creationism and evolution, Genesis has shaped our world and continues to do so today. This wide-ranging account tells the remarkable story of the life of Genesis like no other book.</p></p><p><p>"This is an illuminating account, broad in historical scope and rich in interdisciplinary perspective, of the varied life that the book of Genesis has lived through almost three millennia. The writing is lucid and engaging, and the story of the multifarious receptions of this seminal text is deeply instructive."<b>--Robert Alter, author of <i>The Art of Biblical Narrative</i> and <i>The Art of Biblical Poetry</i></b></p><p>"The book of Genesis has had one of the most intriguingly complex lives of all biblical texts. Superbly interweaving many different readings of Genesis, from the allegorical and scientific to the historical and literary, Ronald Hendel covers diverse moments of reception, such as Galileo's writings, Darwin's theory of evolution, the American Civil War, and Kafka's parables. Each chapter is a gem in its own right--and together they create a spellbinding narrative."<b>--Ilana Pardes, author of <i>Melville's Bibles</i></b></p><p>"Ron Hendel moves easily from classic scholarship on the life that Genesis lived in its biblical birth family to his personal favorites among the biblical book's innumerable afterlives: Rashi and Luther, of course, but also Rabelais, Kafka, and Naguib Mahfouz--a lively lot of lives, in short, with something for everyone."<b>--Jack Miles, author of <i>God: A Biography</i></b></p><p>"This brilliant book is not only about Genesis but also the history of biblical interpretation. It is extremely learned, but it wears its learning lightly. This is great stuff, and there is nothing else like it."<b>--John J. Collins, Yale Divinity School</b></p><p>"This is a wonderful book. Hendel displays his gifts as a teacher, writing in a tone that readers will find accessible and entertaining."<b>--David Carr, Union Theological Seminary</b></p><b>Ronald Hendel</b> is the Norma and Sam Dabby Professor of Hebrew Bible and Jewish Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.

Both readers familiar with modern poetry and newcomers to poets like Marianne Moore and Hart Crane will relish this collection for its elegance and power of discernment. Each essay stakes a definitive claim for the modernist style and its intent to capture an audience beyond the present moment.<br><br>The two general essays that frame <i>Skeptical Music</i> make Bromwich's aesthetic commitments clear. In "An Art without Importance," published here for the first time, Bromwich underscores the trust between author and reader that gives language its subtlety and depth, and makes the written word adequate to the reality that poetry captures. For Bromwich, understanding the work of a poet is like getting to know a person; it is a kind of reading that involves a mutual attraction of temperaments. The controversial final essay, "How Moral Is Taste?," explores the points at which aesthetic and moral considerations uneasily converge. In this timely essay, Bromwich argues that the wish for excitement that poetry draws upon is at once primitive and irreducible.<br><br><i>Skeptical Music</i> most notably offers incomparable readings of individual poets. An essay on the complex relationship between Hart Crane and T. S. Eliot shows how the delicate shifts of tone and shading in their work register both affinity and resistance. A revealing look at W. H. Auden traces the process by which the voice of a generation changed from prophet to domestic ironist. Whether discussing heroism in the poetry of Wallace Stevens, considering self-reflection in the poems of Elizabeth Bishop, or exploring the battle between the self and its images in the work of John Ashbery, <i>Skeptical Music</i> will make readers think again about what poetry is, and even more important, why it still matters.<br></p><p><i>Skeptical Music</i> collects the essays on poetry that have made David Bromwich one of the most widely admired critics now writing.

When it first appeared in 1982, <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> called it "an extraordinary biography of an extraordinary man," and Timothy Ferris, in <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>, said it was "the biography of Einstein he himself would have liked best," adding that "it is a work against which future scientific biographies will be measured." As a respected physicist himself, Pais was the first biographer to give Einstein's thinking its full due, yet despite the occasional high level of science needed to discuss Einstein's ideas, it was the winner of the 1983 American Book Award for Science.<br> Now Pais turns to Niels Bohr, to illuminate the life and thought of another giant of 20th-century physics. Bohr was the first to understand how atoms were put together. He played a major role in shaping the theory of the atomic nucleus, he decoded the atomic spectrum of hydrogen, an achievement which marks him as the founder of the quantum dynamics of atoms, and his concept of complementarity (which provides the philosophical underpinning for quantum theory) qualifies him as one of the twentieth century's greatest philosophers. Pais covers all of these achievements with sophistication and clarity, but he also reveals the many other facets of the man. Perhaps most important, he shows that Bohr was not only a great scientist, but also a great nurturer of young scientific talent, acting as father figure <em>extraordinaire</em> for several generations of physicists. Bohr's Institute of Theoretical Physics, which he founded in Copenhagen and for which he tirelessly raised funds, was the world's leading center for physics all through the 1920s and 1930s, the birthplace of Heisenberg's papers on the uncertainty relations, Dirac's first paper on quantum electrodynamics, and other pivotal works. And Pais reveals as well the personal side of Bohr, the avid reader and crossword puzzle solver (Bohr loved Icelandic sagas, Goethe and Schiller, Dickens and Mark Twain--while studying in England early in his career, he improved his English by reading <em>The Pickwick Papers</em> with a dictionary to one side); his aid to Jews and other refugees in the 1930s and during the war; the tragic loss of his son Christian (who died in a sailing accident right before Bohr's eyes); and his attempts during and after the war to promote openness between East and West, meeting with both Roosevelt and Churchill (the former was quite courteous, the latter lectured Bohr like a schoolboy). <br> <em>Niels Bohr's Times,</em> is a marvelous biography that captures the essence of one of the best-loved figures of this century.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>Abraham Pais</strong> is Detlev W. Bronk Professor of Physics Emeritus at Rockefeller University in New York. He is also the author of <em>'Subtle is the Lord...'</em> (for which he won an American Book Award) and <em>Inward Bound</em>.<br>Advance praise for Neils Bohr's Times<br><br>'To anyone who worked under Bohr and was influenced by him, the book is fascinating and to any physicist with the slightest interest in the history of his subject it is to be highly recommended. ... the picture of intense argument, and excitement, of great minds seeking the truth and of their<br>strengths and weaknesses comes through vividly, as does the central question - does God play dice? Dr Pais has done a fine job.' Sir Nevill Mott, Nobel Laureate<br><br>'Pais gives us an intimate picture of Niels Bohr, the great human being. He also shows in a profound manner how Bohr's ideas on atomic physics and quantum mechanics evolved, often painfully, and guided most of the scientists working in the field.' Hans A Bethe, Nobel Laureate<br><br>'What struck me most was Pais' account of the intellectual battles that established the basis of modern physical science. We now take the truth of quantum mechanics as read, but it was a great and exciting struggle, and Bohr's finest hour.' Sir Sam Edwards FRS<br><br>'A. Pais' "Niels Bohr's Times" illuminates the probing, deep exertion within Bohr that was midwife to the birth of twentieth century physics. One watches audacious improvisation accompanied by internal doubt of sufficiency and substantiality ... It is a pleasure to catch glimpses of the<br>author's humour abd his personal as well as intellectual impressions; Abraham Pais is very much a part of "Niels Bohr's Times".' Mitchell Feigenbaum<br><br>`Niels Bohr could not have asked for a better biographer than Abraham Pais.' The New York Times Book Review<br><br>`A close-up portrait of a truly extraordinary, and extraordinarily appealing, personality..... Pais is himself a physicist of great distinction. He writes with authority and, in addition, with unfailing grace and considerable charm.' Science<br><br>`Abraham Pais is a physicist who has made fundamental contributions to the quantum picture of reality. But during the last 14 years he has shown himself to be a historian of science who combines deep scientific insight with meticulous scholarship. He is perhaps the unique example in modern<br>times of a world-class physicist turned historian.' London Review of Books<br><br>`For many people, a review of this book will not be needed. Anyone familiar with Abraham Pais's pervious historical/biographical studies of Einstein (Subtle is the Lord) or particle physics (Inward Bound) will already be certain that this book about Bohr is one which must go to the top of the<br>priority list.' The Observatory<br><br>'The book is a delight to read, and Pais gives the layman a glimpse into the make-up of a great man, and also a glimpse into the make-up of the world.'<br>Paul Roberton, Regina Leader Post, 10 October 1992<br><br>'Through a detailed and eminently readable account of Bohr's life and work, his importance to the development of twentieth century physics is established without a doubt ... this very rich book, to which it is impossible to do full justice within the confines of this review.

But it comes nowhere close to describing the legal system in practice. Millions of Americans lack any access to justice, let alone equal access. Worse, the increasing centrality of law in American life and its growing complexity has made access to legal assistance critical for all citizens. Yet according to most estimates about four-fifths of the legal needs of the poor, and two- to three-fifths of the needs of middle-income individuals remain unmet. This book reveals the inequities of legal assistance in America, from the lack of access to educational services and health benefits to gross injustices in the criminal defense system. It proposes a specific agenda for change, offering tangible reforms for coordinating comprehensive systems for the delivery of legal services, maximizing individual's opportunities to represent themselves, and making effective legal services more affordable for all Americans who need them.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Deborah L.

She has received the Keck Foundation Award for Distinguished Scholarship on Legal Ethics by the American Bar Foundation as well as the Pro Bono Publico Award from the American Bar Association. This is her twelfth book.<br>Few Americans would complain that the U.S. lacks for lawyers. But a distinguished Stanford law professor sharply criticizes a legal system in which only the wealthy can afford essential services from the country's numerous attorneys. As legislators cut budgets for legal-aid providers and as prestigious law firms reduce their pro bono commitments to mere lip service, the poor find themselves represented by unqualified and negligent lawyers in criminal cases and by no one at all in civil courts and bureaucratic proceedings. Warning that the time has long passed for empty boasts of the unique fairness of American justice, Rhode summons policy makers, lawyers, and ordinary citizens to join her in pressing for urgently needed reforms. Those reforms--here detailed-- include the development of procedures for resolving disputes without lawyers or court hearings, the distribution of legal self-help materials, the expansion of pro bono services, and the adequate funding of legal-aid agencies. Not all readers will embrace Rhode's agenda for change, but her analysis of legal injustices will spark much-needed debate. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

One of the most challenging I ever heard came during Bill Clinton's presidency when he was engulfed in the firestorm ignited by the revelation of his extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern. </p> <p>Despite intense public and media pressure, Clinton continued to fulfill his presidential obligations, among them hosting a state visit by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair. On the afternoon of February 6, 1998, after the two heads of state made their customary prepared statements to the press, President Clinton opened the floor to questions from an audience packed with reporters. At that point, he became fair game for nonstate questions on the subject that was uppermost in the minds of the media and the public. One question in particular came from Wolf Blitzer, the senior CNN political correspondent:</p> <blockquote> <p>Mr. President, Monica Lewinsky's life has been changed forever, her family's life has been changed forever. I wonder how you feel about that and what, if anything, you'd like to say to Monica Lewinsky at this minute?</p> </blockquote> <p>The stinging question brought a few scattered titters from the other reporters. Looking straight ahead, right at Blitzer, Clinton smiled and bit his lower lip, an expression that had become his trademark.</p> <p>Then he said,</p> <blockquote> <p>That's good!</p> </blockquote> <p>The crowded room erupted in laughter. After it subsided, Clinton continued:</p> <blockquote> <p>That's good...but at this minute, I am going to stick with my position and not comment.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blitzer had nailed the acknowledged charismatic master of communication skills at his own game, and the master acknowledged it publicly for all to hear. Fortunately for Clinton, he was able to default to his legal situation and not answer. </p> <p>Very few people on the face of this planet have the expertise, the charm, the quickness of wit, or the legal circumstances to respond so deftly to challenging questions. Yet very few people on the face of this planet sail through life without being confronted with tough questions. The purpose of this book and its many real-life examples is to provide you with the skills to handle such questions, and <i>only</i> such questions. If all the questions you are ever faced with were of the "Where do I sign?" variety, you could spend your time with a good mystery novel instead. Forewarned is forearmed.</p> <p>One other forewarning: All the techniques you are about to learn require absolute truth. The operative word in the paragraph above, as well as on the cover of this book, is "handle," meaning how to deal with tough questions. While providing an answer is an integral part of that "handling," every answer you give to every question you get must be honest and straightforward. If not, all the other techniques will be for naught. With a truthful answer as your foundation, all those techniques will enable you to survive, if not prevail, in the line of fire.</p> <p><b>Challenging Questions</b></p> <p>We begin our journey of discovery by understanding why people ask challenging questions. Journalists such as Wolf Blitzer ask these kinds of questions because, being familiar with the classical art of drama, they know that conflict creates drama. Aristotle 101.</p> <p>Why do people in business ask challenging questions? Because they are mean-spirited? Perhaps. Because they want to test your mettle? Perhaps. More likely it is because when you are presenting your case, which is <i>just</i> the case in almost every decisive communication in business...as well as in <i>all</i> walks of life...you are asking your opposite party or parties, your target audience, to change. Most human beings are resistant to change, and so they kick the tires. <i>You</i> are the tires.</p> <p>In the most mission-critical of all business presentations, the Initial Public Offering (IPO) road show...a form of communication I have had the opportunity and privilege to influence with nearly 500 companies, among them Cisco Systems, Intuit, Yahoo!, and Dolby Laboratories...presenters ask their investor audiences to change: to buy a stock that never existed. In fact, when companies offer shares to the public for the first time, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission mandates that the companies specifically state their intentions in print. The SEC requires distribution of a prospectus containing a boilerplate sentence that reads, "There has been no prior public market for the company's common stock." In other words, "Invest at your own risk." <i>Caveat emptor</i>. As a result, when the companies' executive teams take their presentations on the road, they are inevitably assaulted with challenging questions from their potential investors.</p> <p>While the stakes in an IPO road show are exceedingly high...in the tens of millions of dollars...the character of the challenge is no different from that of potential customers considering a new product, potential partners considering a strategic relationship, pressured managers considering a request for additional expenditures, concerned citizens considering a dark horse candidate, or even affluent contributors considering a donation to a nascent, not-for-profit cause.</p> <p>The inherent challenge in these circumstances is compounded in presentation settings where the intensity level is raised by several additional factors:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i> Public exposure</i>. The risk of a mistake is magnified in large groups.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i> Group dynamics</i>. The more people in the audience, the more difficult it is to maintain control. </p> </li> <li> <p> <i> One against many</i>. Audiences have an affinity bond among themselves and apart from the presenter or speaker. </p> </li> </ul> <p>The result is open season on the lone figure spotlighted at the front of the room, who then becomes fair game for a volley of even more challenging questions.</p> <p>How, then, to level the playing field? How, then, to give the presenter the weapons to withstand the attack? How, then, to survive the <i>slings</i> <i>and</i> <i>arrows</i> unleashed in the form of questions? </p> <p>The answer lies in the David versus Goliath match, in which a mere youth was able to defeat a mighty giant using only a stone from a slingshot. This biblical parable has numerous equivalents in military warfare. History abounds with examples in which small, outnumbered, under-equipped units were able to combat vastly superior forces by using adroit maneuvers and clever defenses. Remember the Alamo, but also remember Thermopylae, Masada, Agincourt, The Bastille, Stalingrad, The Battle of the Bulge, Iwo Jima, and The Six-Day War. All these legendary battles share one common denominator: leverage, or the use of <i>agility to counter force</i>. </p> <p><b>Martial Arts</b></p> <p>For our purposes, the most pertinent modern equivalent is the martial arts, in which a skilled practitioner can compete with a superior opponent by using dexterity rather than might. Bruce Lee, a diminutive kick boxer, became an international star by virtue of his uncanny ability to prevail over multiple and mightier <i>armed</i> opponents using <i>only</i> his flying feet and hands. Evolved from Asian philosophy and religion, the martial arts employ these critical mental and physical skills:</p> <ul> <p>Concentration</p> <p>Self-defense </p> <p>Balance</p> <p>Agility</p> <p>Discipline</p> <p>Self-control</p> </ul> <p>A solitary presenter or speaker facing challenging questions from a hostile audience can deploy these same pivotal dynamics <i>against a sea of troubles and, by opposing, end them</i>. This book will translate each of these martial arts skills into Q&amp;A techniques and then demonstrate how you can apply them in your mission-critical encounters. The objective is to put you in charge of those sessions and enable you to win in your exchanges when it counts.</p> <p>This objective can be stated in one word, although it will take 168 pages to present them in full. That one word is <i>control</i>. When you are confronted with tough questions, you can control</p> <ul> <li> <p> The question</p> </li> <li> <p> Your answer </p> </li> <li> <p> The questioner</p> </li> <li> <p> The audience</p> </li> <li> <p> The time</p> </li> <li> <p> Yourself</p> </li> </ul> <p><b>Effective Management Perceived</b></p> <p>A synonym for the verb "control" is "manage." Therefore, the subliminal perception of a well-handled question is <i>Effective Management</i>. Of course, no one in your target audience is going to conclude that because you fielded a tough question well, you are a good manager. That is a bit of a stretch. But the converse proves the point. If your response to a challenging question is defensive, evasive, or contentious, you lose credibility...and with it the likelihood of attaining your objective in the interchange. If your response is prompt, assured, and to the point, you will be far more likely to emerge unscathed, if not fully victorious.</p> <p>This concept goes all the way back to the first millennium. In <i>Beowulf</i>, the heroic saga that is one of the foundation works of the English language, one of the lines reads: "Behavior that's admired is the path to power among people everywhere." </p> <p>In the twenty-first century, that same concept as it relates to tough questions was expressed by David Bellet, the Chairman of Crown Advisors International, one of Wall Street's most successful long-term investment firms. Having been an early backer of many successful companies, among them Hewlett-Packard, Sony, and Intel, David is solicited to invest almost daily. In response, he often fires challenging questions at his petitioners.</p> <p>"When I ask questions," says David, "I don't really have to have the full answer because I can't know the subject as well as the presenter. What I look for is whether the presenter has thought about the question, been candid, thorough, and direct and how the presenter handles himself or herself under stress; if that person has the passion of 'fire in the belly' and can stand tall in the line of fire." </p> <p><b>Baptism Under Fire</b></p> <p>I, too, was once in the business of asking tough questions. Before becoming a presentation coach for those nearly 500 IPO road shows, as well as for thousands of other presentations ranging from raising private capital to launching products, seeking partnerships, and requisitioning budget approvals, I spent a decade as a news and public affairs producer at CBS Television in New York. As a student of the classical art of drama and with the full knowledge that conflict creates drama, I became an expert at asking challenging questions. </p> <p>My baptism under fire came early in my tenure at CBS. In 1963, I was assigned to be the Associate Producer of a documentary series called <i>Eye on New York</i>, whose host was the then newly hired Mike Wallace. Although <i>Sixty Minutes</i>, Mike's magnum opus, would not debut for another five years, he came to CBS largely on the strength of the reputation he had developed on another New York television station as an aggressive interrogator on a series called <i>Night Beat</i>. Mike had regularly bombarded his <i>Night Beat</i> guests with tough questions and was intent on maintaining his inquisitorial reputation at CBS. He fully expected his Associate Producer to provide him with live ammunition for his firepower. Heaven help me when I did not. </p> <p>Fortunately, I survived Mike's slings and arrows by learning how to devise tough questions. In the process, I also learned how to handle those same questions. This book is a compilation of those techniques, seasoned and battle-tested for nearly 20 years in business with my corporate clients. </p> <p>You will find the techniques illustrated with a host of examples from the business world, as well as from the white-hot cauldron of debate in the political world.* In that world...unlike business and other areas of persuasive endeavor where facts and logic are at stake...the issue is a contest of individuals pitted one against the other in mortal combat: Only the winner survives. Although the lone presenter or speaker pitted against the challenging forces of an audience is not quite as lethal as politics, the one-against-many odds raise the stakes. Therefore, analyzing the dynamics of political debate will serve as a tried and tested role model for your Q&amp;A skills. The following pages will provide you with an arsenal of weapons you will need when you step into the line of fire. </p> <p>Expanding upon David Bellet's observation, the objective of this book is not so much to show you how to respond with the right answers as it is to show you how to establish a positive perception with your audiences by giving them the confidence that you can manage adversity, stay the course, and stay in control.</p> <p> <b>*For a companion DVD of the original videos of these examples, please visit www.powerltd.com.</b> </p> <br> <p>� Copyright Pearson Education.

Since her disappearance in 1937, people have questioned not only her actual death, but many aspects of her life, including the nature of the relationship with her husband, the flamboyant publishing magnate George Palmer Putnam, and even her very competency as a flier. Now, with <i>East to the Dawn</i> , Susan Butler offers the most comprehensive account to date of Earhart's extraordinary life&#x2014;and finally sets the record straight.The image we have of Amelia Earhart today&#x2014;a tousle-haired, androgynous flier clad in shirt, silk scarf, leather jacket, and goggles&#x2014;is only one of her many personas, most of which have been lost to us through the years. Many of her accomplishments have been obscured by a growing obsession with the mystery of her disappearance. As well, Earhart herself was a master of putting on faces: a woman constantly striving for success and personal freedom in the 1920s and '30s, she could scarcely afford to let on when something was troubling her. Through years of research, however, as well as interviews with many of the surviving people who knew Amelia, Susan Butler has recreated a remarkably vivid and multi-faceted portrait of this enigmatic figure. As a result, readers experience Amelia in all her permutations: not just as a pilot, but also as an educator, a social worker, a lecturer, a businesswoman, and a tireless promoter of women's rights; we experience a remarkably energetic and enterprising woman who succeeded in life beyond her wildest dreams, while never losing sight of her beginnings; and we experience a woman who battled incredible odds to achieve her fame, while ensuring that her success would secure a path for women after her.Some odds, are insurmountable, however, and this fact became painfully evident on the last leg of Earhart's round-the-world- flight. In the chapters describing the last flight, Butler deals with and dispels some of the most pernicious myths about Amelia&#x2014;for instance, that her disappearance was planned as part of an espionage mission against the Japanese. Instead, she offers a less romantic but ultimately tragic scenario: that the Electra's limited navigational equipment was unable to find Howland Island&#x2014;a piece of land the size of the Cleveland Airport&#x2014;in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and a great flier died at sea.Butler masterfully renders this portrait of the first lady of aviation in a story filled with drama, pathos, and humor. <i>East to the Dawn</i> is a landmark biography, and will be the definitive life of Amelia Earhart for years to come.</p><p><br>Of the dozen or so books (mostly wild fantasies)that I have read about Amelia Earhart, Susan Butler's is the only one which re-creates accurately that singular woman whom my father was in love with, as indeed was I, aged ten, when the lady vanished.<br>Gore Vidal<br>&nbsp;SUSAN BUTLER, whose mother was a member of Amelia Earhart s flying organization, the Ninety-Nines, is a journalist with an M.A. degree from Columbia University whose work has appeared in the New York Times and Barron s, among other publications.

Bush as he advocated the charge for war against Iraq. This carefully staged performance, writes Susan Brewer, was the culmination of a long tradition of sophisticated wartime propaganda in America. <br>In <em>Why America Fights</em>, Brewer offers a fascinating history of how successive presidents have conducted what Donald Rumsfeld calls "perception management," from McKinley's war in the Philippines to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Her intriguing account ranges from analyses of wartime messages to descriptions of the actual operations, from the dissemination of patriotic ads and posters to the management of newspaper, radio, and TV media. When Woodrow Wilson carried the nation into World War I, he created the Committee on Public Information, led by George Creel, who called his job "the world's greatest adventure in advertising." In World War II, Roosevelt's Office of War Information avowed a "strategy of truth," though government propaganda still depicted Japanese soldiers as buck-toothed savages. After examining the ultimately failed struggle to cast the Vietnam War in a favorable light, Brewer shows how the Bush White House drew explicit lessons from that history as it engaged in an unprecedented effort to sell a preemptive war in Iraq. Yet the thrust of its message was not much different from McKinley's pronouncements about America's civilizing mission. <br>Impressively researched and argued, filled with surprising details, <em>Why America Fights</em> shows how presidents have consistently drummed up support for foreign wars by appealing to what Americans want to believe about themselves.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susan A. Brewer</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point. She is the author of <em>To Win the Peace: British Propaganda in the United States during World War II</em>.<br>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Colman McCarthy Exactly a month after 9/11 and four days after American bomber pilots began killing people in Afghanistan, President George W. Bush sought to justify Operation Enduring Freedom: "It's a different kind of war. It's not the kind of war that we're used to in America. . . . It requires a different type of approach and a different type of mentality." The words were strikingly similar to those uttered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on Feb. 23, 1942: "This war is a new kind of war. It is different from all other wars of the past, not only in its methods and weapons but also in its geography." Nearly two years later, in August 2003, Bush's cry that "our military is confronting terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan and in other places so our people will not have to confront terrorist violence in New York or St. Louis or Los Angeles" echoed another president, Lyndon Johnson, and his 1966 plaint: "If we don't stop the Reds in South Vietnam, tomorrow they will be in Hawaii, and next week they will be in San Francisco." Like waves cresting in mid-ocean, presidential war whoops keep rolling along with a bland sameness. But the repetitions run deeper than mere surface rhetoric. In "Why America Fights," Susan A. Brewer, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, says wartime presidents chant political propaganda instinctively, as if leveling with the citizenry would rally dissent and gum the chances for conquest. In understated prose and meticulous detail -- 595 end notes in six chapters -- Brewer ably argues that the strategies of presidential persuasion for starting or remaining in wars are little more than watery stews of lies, bluffs and exaggerations or the perfuming of facts to scent the air with what Donald Rumsfeld called "perception management." Brewer examines the narratives of six military efforts: the Philippine War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Iraq war. Under a succession of presidents -- McKinley, Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Bush -- American involvement was enshrined as humanitarian and the enemy demonized as barbaric. Whether the United States went to the Philippines to aid what William McKinley called our "little brown brothers," or to Iraq for what Bush called "a divine mission," or to extend Madeleine Albright's credo that America is "the indispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future than other countries," Americans suffered few civilian casualties and saw other lands ravaged, not their own. With presidents trying to persuade -- not educate -- the public, Brewer writes, a "propaganda campaign seeks to disguise a paradoxical message: war is not a time for citizens to have an informed debate and make up their own minds even as they fight in the name of freedom to do just that." Brewer's scholarship on the manipulation of public opinion places her in the company of Noam Chomsky, James Loewen, Michael True, Howard Zinn and other historians or social analysts of skeptical bent. Like them, she scours the record to counter the historical amnesia of the public. She documents how presidents at war portrayed themselves as travelers on the high road to peace and justice, not the low road to battle and dystopia: "Throughout the twentieth century, American leaders presented war aims dedicated to the spread of democracy and freedom rather than the expansion of U.S. power." Although, Brewer writes, "the United States repeatedly denied that it sought more territory, it steadily acquired naval and military bases. As of 2008, the United States had more than seven hundred bases in 132 countries. . . . Its priority was the maintenance of governments, whether democratic or not, that allowed the Americans economic and strategic access to their countries." "Why America Fights" would be stronger had a chapter been devoted to the mainstream media, which so often act as dummies dandled on the knees of presidential ventriloquists mouthing propaganda. While Brewer touches on the collective complicity in spots -- the Pentagon's Office of Media Outreach and its "Operation Truth" campaign to bring pliant talk show hosts to Iraq, the Committee on Public Information that sold reporters on Woodrow Wilson's "war to end war" policies -- her analysis lacks the depth found in Norman Solomon's 2005 book, "War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death" or William Blum's 2003 "Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II." Brewer's interpretation of presidential propaganda is likely to be dismissed by keepers of the temple's secrets as a baleful outburst by a lefty professor hawking her ideological assumptions. That might be plausible, except that "Why America Fights" soars well above the usual marks of bias: carelessness, rants or conclusions not connected to facts. Brewer's work is one with George Orwell's line in "Homage to Catalonia": "One of the most horrible features of war is that the war-propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred, comes invariably from people who are not fighting." It also gives credibility to Martin Luther King Jr.'s April 4, 1967, comment: "The greatest purveyor of violence in the world today [is] my own government." The accuracy of that judgment, heightened, not lessened, by the passing of time, might be better relished if more historians were as questioning as Susan Brewer. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

Historian Sir Noel Malcolm takes this document as a point of departure to explore the lives of the entire Bruni family, whose members included an archbishop of the Balkans, the captain of the papal flagship at the Battle of Lepanto--at which the Ottomans were turned back in the Eastern Mediterranean--in 1571, and a highly placed interpreter in Istanbul, formerly Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire that fell to the Turks in 1453. The taking of Constantinople had profoundly altered the map of the Mediterranean. By the time of Bruni's document, Albania, largely a Venetian province from 1405 onward, had been absorbed into the Ottoman Empire. Even under the Ottomans, however, this was a world marked by the ferment of the Italian Renaissance. <br><br>In<em> Agents of Empire</em>, Malcolm uses the collective biography of the Brunis to paint a fascinating and intimate picture of Albania at a moment when it represented the frontier between empires, cultures, and religions. The lives of the polylingual, cosmopolitan Brunis shed new light on the interrelations between the Ottoman and Christian worlds, characterized by both conflict and complex interdependence. The result of years of archival detective work, <em>Agents of Empire</em> brings to life a vibrant moment in European and Ottoman history, challenging our assumptions about their supposed differences. Malcolm's book guides us through the exchanges between East and West, Venetians and the Ottomans, and tells a story of worlds colliding with and transforming one another.</p><p><br><strong>Noel Malcolm</strong> is a Senior Research Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford.<br><br>"Malcolm is the definitive academic historian: a research professor at All Souls College, Oxford, intimidatingly multilingual, a trained archival detective and a fiercely engaging writer.

But all too often the scholars writing it have focused their attention almost exclusively on the Christian experience, with only passing reference to other traditions of both science and faith. At a time when religious ignorance and misunderstanding have lethal consequences, such provincialism must be avoided and, in this pioneering effort to explore the historical relations of what we now call "science" and "religion," the authors go beyond the Abrahamic traditions to examine the way nature has been understood and manipulated in regions as diverse as ancient China, India, and sub-Saharan Africa. <em>Science and Religion around the World</em> also provides authoritative discussions of science in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- as well as an exploration of the relationship between science and the loss of religious beliefs. The narratives included in this book demonstrate the value of plural perspectives and of the importance of location for the construction and perception of science-religion relations.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Hedley Brooke</strong> held the Andreas Idreos Chair of Science and Religion and Directorship of the Ian Ramsey Centre at Oxford University from 1999 to 2006.

It is about everything I know and about everything I think you should know, too.<br> &nbsp;<br> I realize that may sound a little crazy, but I&#x2019;m completely serious. We live in an age of unprecedented access to information. When you pick up your phone or open your laptop and go online, you are instantly connected to a trillion trillion bytes of data; that&#x2019;s a 1 followed by 24 zeros. Every year another billion trillion bytes of data move around the Internet, carrying everything from those important videos with kitty cats to the arcane but fantastic detailed results of subatomic particle collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. In that sense, talking about &#x201c;everything&#x201d; is easy. Everything you and I know, and everything we need to know, is already out there for the taking.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet despite all those whizzing ones and zeros&#x2014;the collective intelligence of billions of human brains&#x2014;I still feel that we seem awfully . . . well, stupid. We&#x2019;re not using all this shared wisdom to solve big problems. We&#x2019;re not facing up to climate change. We haven&#x2019;t figured out how to make clean, renewable, reliable energy available to everyone. Too many people die in avoidable auto accidents, succumb to curable diseases, do not get enough food and clean water, and still do not have access to the Internet&#x2019;s great busy beehive mind. Despite being more connected than ever before, we&#x2019;re not particularly generous toward, or understanding of, one another, preferring to hide behind denial and personal bias. The flood of information has effectively allowed us to know something about everything, but that knowing is clearly not enough. We need to be able to sort the facts and put our knowledge into action, and that is why I wrote this book.<br> &nbsp;<br> I want to see humanity band together and change the world. I think it will take a special kind of personality to get this done: people who can handle the modern overflow of information, take in everything all at once, and select the parts that matter. It requires rigorous honesty about the nature of our problems. It requires creative irreverence in the search for solutions. The process of science and natural laws don&#x2019;t care about our politics or preconceptions. They merely set the boundaries of what is possible, defining the outer limits of what we can achieve&#x2014;or not, should we shy away from the challenge.<br> &nbsp;<br> Fortunately, there is a large and growing clan of people who think that way, who love nothing better than using the tools of reason to solve the most unsolvable-looking puzzles. We call them &#x201c;nerds,&#x201d; and I humbly (proudly) count myself among them. I have spent a lifetime developing the nerd mindset and trying to master the admirable but often elusive qualities that come with it: persistence in the pursuit of a lofty goal, resilience to keep trying no matter what the obstacles are, humility for when one approach turns out to be a dead end, and the patience to examine the problem from every angle until a path forward becomes clear. If you already consider yourself one of us, then join me in doing more by applying your nerdiness to the big problems of the day, not just to trivia or minutia (although of course we will set aside plenty of time for those). And if you don&#x2019;t consider yourself a nerd yet, join me all the same: You will soon discover that everybody has an inner nerd waiting to be awoken by the right passion. My whole life has been a series of those kinds of awakenings, moments of epiphany when<br> I became evermore aware of the joyous power of science, math, and engineering.<br> &nbsp;<br> It happened to me with a jolt in the 11th grade in Washington, DC, when I took formal physics for the first time. In nerd culture, we might write that it was my phirst phormal physics, and we&#x2019;d phind that phrasing rather phunny. The &#x201c;ph&#x201d; pronounced phonetically with the same fricative that produces the sound from the consonant &#x201c;f&#x201d; is from phi, the Greek letter &#x3c6;. The Roman &#x201c;p&#x201d; looks vaguely like a Greek &#x3c6;. In Greek, the &#x201c;f&#x201d; sounds a little breathy, so the Roman letter &#x201c;h&#x201d; serves to preserve that sound or tradition. I couldn&#x2019;t help myself&#x2014;I had to stop typing and look up the roots of the &#x201c;ph&#x201d; in our words &#x201c;physics&#x201d; and &#x201c;phosphate.&#x201d; When we see these &#x201c;ph&#x201d; words, we know they came to us from ancient Greek and then Latin. The scholars call it &#x201c;transliteration,&#x201d; meaning &#x201c;across the letters.&#x201d; Centuries ago a diligent, perhaps even enthusiastic, transliterator was inclined to add that &#x201c;h&#x201d; to the &#x201c;p,&#x201d; and here we are. Phew.<br> &nbsp;<br> This little digression encapsulates what it means to be so into a topic, so phocused and phascinated by some aspect of nature or the human experience, that people consider you&#x2014;or more important, you consider yourself&#x2014;a nerd. For me to really enjoy some deliberate misspelled wordplay, I had to think about the background of &#x3c6;, &#x201c;ph,&#x201d; and &#x201c;f.&#x201d; I called on my knowledge that most English speakers pronounce the letter &#x3c6; like the second syllable in &#x201c;Wi-Fi,&#x201d; but Greek speakers pronounce &#x3c6; like &#x201c;fee,&#x201d; as in &#x201c;Fee-fi-fo-fum, / I smell the blood of a nerdy one.&#x201d; And as I was checking that out, I recalled that &#x3c6; has other intriguing connections to physics besides the linguistic one. It is the mathematical symbol denoting the golden ratio, a fundamental geometric proportion that appears widely in biology, economics, and especially art. In statistics, &#x3c6; is a measure of the correlation between two separate factors, and so it is a crucial measure for distinguishing chance events from cause and effect in scientific experiments. Stick that in your back pocket.<br> &nbsp;<br> You might regard the things I just told you as little more than bits of playful trivia, but I beg to differ. The knowledge I gained in my obsessive pursuit of &#x3c6; changed me a little, and it just changed you, as well. The impulse to chase down details is central to the way I have solved problems throughout my life. It is also, not coincidentally, a defining nerd trait. Further evidence of my detail-oriented outlook: Long before the ubiquity of the Internet, my friends would say about me, &#x201c;The party doesn&#x2019;t start until Bill gets out the dictionary.&#x201d; I like to know the background of words, the etymology, as well as the meanings of the words themselves. While I was ref lecting on the digraph &#x201c;ph&#x201d; just now, I was also reflecting on what started that train of thought&#x2014;namely physics, the study of nature, specifically energy and motion&#x2014;and the joy I felt when I was first (or phirst) exposed to it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The word &#x201c;scientist&#x201d; was coined in 1833 by the English natural philosopher William Whewell. Before then, the term was &#x201c;natural philosopher,&#x201d; which sounds a little odd today but back then was a familiar expression. Philosophy is the study of knowledge; philosophers seek ways to know whether or not something is true, so natural philosophy was the study of what&#x2019;s true in nature. Or, in modern terms, a scientist is a natural philosopher seeking objective truths.<br> &nbsp;<br> We look for laws of nature that enable anyone to make concrete predictions regarding the outcomes of tests and experiments. Science belongs to anyone who loves to think and look for connections in nature. It&#x2019;s not all about math and measurement, but wow, the math is what gives the predictions their precious precision. We can know the motions of distant worlds to such a degree of accuracy that we can land the Curiosity rover on Mars or send the New Horizons probe past Pluto with near-pinpoint accuracy. We can measure the exact age of a billion-year-old rock by clocking the decay of the radioactive atoms it contains. The combined power of math and science is amazing. That&#x2019;s why nerds are so drawn to them, but the insights that come from science are inspirational even to those who never plan to crunch the numbers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Digressions and micro-obsessions seem to come naturally to those who catch the science bug. You may meet people who are into trivia or who adore the very small details of some area of study. It might be the names of counties in Maryland or Mississippi or the writing credits on Star Trek. My claim is that by learning those details, these nerdy people know something extra about a bigger picture, as well. The trivia expert (a trivialist?) has in his or her head a framework of an area of study, outfitted with the appropriate memory hooks on which to hang more information, which in turn enhances and fills in the bigger picture.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s much easier to remember the names of counties if you have a mental picture of a state map that indicates what county is contiguous with what other county. The names, the map, the driving distances to the state capital&#x2014;they&#x2019;re all much easier to keep track of if you have the details properly placed in a mental map. This big-picture frame, combined with detailed views of the world, enhances one&#x2019;s ability to navigate across county lines, carry out commands on a sailboat, or do a little brain surgery. I&#x2019;ve found this to be a recurring theme in my most formative experiences: The details inform the big picture as much as the big picture organizes the details. Is it enough simply to know where Maryland is on a map? Maybe, but the extra knowledge of the state&#x2019;s inner workings creates a much clearer picture and brings with it immeasurable value.<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m encouraged by how deeply nerd behaviors have been absorbed into mainstream culture. Not so long ago, the nerds were often defined in opposition to the popular kids in school. Nowadays, it&#x2019;s downright fashionable to exhibit an obsessive attention to detail&#x2014;not just in science but in nearly anything. The kind of trivia knowledge that was once considered a TV game-show oddity is now a staple of Thursday night social gatherings at hip neighborhood bars. Another encouraging sign: The most popular show on television as I&#x2019;m writing this is <i>The Big</i><br><i> Bang Theory</i>, which every week overwhelms sitcoms, dramas, and news commentary in the ratings. Tens of millions of people apparently identify with an odd bunch of characters who are nominally engaged in complex science but who also display their very human quirks.<br> &nbsp;<br> ---<br> &nbsp;<br> Now, as much as I love nerds and nerd culture, I have also observed some worrisome trends over the last years that have motivated me to speak out. On the surface, things look promising. The increased attention to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) learning is terrific; it&#x2019;s great that programmers and tech-oriented entrepreneurs have become major celebrities in our culture and businesses. After all, our society is increasingly dependent on technology, and we will be in deep trouble if very few people understand the scientific ideas that the technology depends on. What&#x2019;s not to love? The growing fondness for trivia and geek-speak would seem like a great thing.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the current pop version of nerd culture leaves me with a nagging concern. Geeking out&#x2014;going fanatical about characters in comic books, for example&#x2014;can be fun. It can develop a community of people whose lives are enriched by sharing a common interest. It brings&nbsp;together hundreds of thousands of people every year at Comic-Con and the like. But it&#x2019;s most definitely not the same as diligently studying math and science to grasp the complexities of climate, to engineer a disease- or pest-resistant crop, or to become one of our time-honored quintessential smart people: a rocket scientist. Geeking out is driven by the same instinct to hoard information, but the application of the knowledge is a different and considerably harder-working sort of thing. It takes me right back to my original thought: Information and application are very different things. When I talk reverently about the nerd mindset, I&#x2019;m extolling the virtues of a worldview that involves gathering as much information as possible and being constantly on the lookout for ways to use it for the greater good.<br> &nbsp;<br> The difference between information and application may seem obvious to someone reading along here, but it&#x2019;s not obvious to a great many people in the general public. There are charlatans and cult leaders out there who are able to pawn off false details and bias as fact and reason. I continually meet people who espouse their own stories of the origin of the universe and how we all got here, attempting to pawn off false information and bias as fact and reason. I&#x2019;m not talking about traditional religious believers; I&#x2019;m referring to people who string together some general concepts into their own quasi-physical theory of the big bang (or black holes, or some secret way to &#x201c;fix&#x201d; Einstein&#x2019;s relativity theory). I also meet and hear about too many people who exploit bits of scientific information to peddle worthless products, to promote counterfactual political arguments, to sow fear, and to justify sexist or racist thinking. In some cases, these people seem to genuinely think they are doing science, but they aren&#x2019;t. They may even think of themselves as nerds, but they really aren&#x2019;t. They adopt the language of physics or biology without having spent the time to know the established science and current thinking with regard to the stars and the space-time these stars inhabit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s another important cautionary point: It&#x2019;s very easy for us, any of us, to draw faulty conclusions from a small sample of events. Superficial familiarity with nerd-style thinking may even encourage it. If you switch off the lights in your living room at the same moment two cars smack into each other outside, you might conclude that your switch-throwing caused a car crash. You might decide to never touch that switch again, at least not while there are any cars passing by. Or you might wait for a particularly disliked neighbor to cruise past and then start switching that switch as fast as you can.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this extreme case, the cause-and-effect connection seems obviously wrong. I imagine the readers of this book have no trouble concluding that there is almost certainly no link between a light switch in your house and automobile-driver attentiveness (unless it causes the light to shine right into oncoming windshields, in which case, please switch it off right now). But what if it&#x2019;s a much more subtle effect, like reading that people who drink red wine are less likely to have heart attacks? Or that people with certain skin colors have lower IQs? At different times, some very inf luential researchers became convinced that such things were correlated. Should you believe them?</p><h2>Neuroanatomy Text and Atlas, Fourth Edition (NEUROANATOMY TEXT &amp; ATLAS (MARTIN))</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>A regional and functional approach to learning human neuroanatomy</b></p><p><b><i>New full-color images</i></b></p><b><i><p><strong>A Doody's Core Title for 2015!</strong></p></i></b><p><i>Neuroanatomy:Text and Atlas</i> covers neuroanatomy from both a functional and regional perspective to provide an understanding of how the components of the central nervous system work together to sense the world around us, regulate body systems, and produce behavior.

Lively and insightful, it covers all of his most significant themes, including man's need for a God and the mechanics of dream analysis. One of his most famous books, it perfectly captures the feelings of confusion that many sense today. Generation X might be a recent concept, but Jung spotted its forerunner over half a century ago. For anyone seeking meaning in today's world, <em>Modern Man in Search of a Soul</em> is a must.</p><p><strong>Carl Gustav Jung</strong> (1875-1961). Founded the analytical school of psychology and developed a radical new theory of the unconscious.&#39;He was more than a psychological or scientific phenomenon; he was to my mind one of the greatest religious phenomena the world has ever experienced.&#39; - Laurens van der Post &#39;His psychological approach is deeply interesting and should stimulate many who are today more ready to trust a doctor than a clergyman, to help them to rediscover the meaning of life.&#39; - The Guardian &#39;Jung was the first to see that, of all the crises facing humanity, the lack of any sense of meaning in life is the crisis that guarantees all the rest. Whether the reader self-defines as modern, late modern of post-modern, the predicament that Jung lays out in bleak detail still strikes a chord. His suggestion that any possible solutions - political ecological, philosophical or religious - must include and respect elements of what lies deep within the psyche (&#39;the soul&#39;) continues to challenge and to inspire.&#39; - Andrew Samuels, Professor of Analytical Psychology, University of Essex &#39;This slim volume contains the quintessence of Jung&#39;s thinking. Originally published in 1933, it was the first readily accessible presentation in English of the great psychologist&#39;s basic ideas about psychotherapy, dream interpretation, psychological types, the stages of life and his differences with Sigmund Freud. His observations on the relationship between the &#34;archaic man&#34; and &#34;modern man&#34; anticipate those of contemporary evolutionary psychiatry, while his diagnosis of what alls western culture has been endorsed by subsequent history.

Its concept-based approach requires students to participate actively, assume more responsibility for their knowledge, integrate concepts, apply information, and use clinical reasoning. Instead of memorizing thousands of alterations, students gain in-depth knowledge of selected alterations, and learn how to apply that knowledge as new challenges and client presentations come their way. The first of two volumes, this fully-updated Volume I focuses on 21 crucial biophysical concepts: acid-base balance; cellular regulation; comfort; digestion; elimination; fluids/electrolytes; health, wellness, and illness; immunity; infection; inflammation; intracranial regulation; metabolism; mobility; nutrition; oxygenation; perfusion; perioperative care; sensory perception; sexuality; thermoregulation, and tissue integrity. These concepts are illuminated with nearly 100 exemplars covering the entire lifespan.</p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p> <p></p> <strong>CONSISTENT PEDAGOGY FOR IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE RETENTION:</strong> The textbook series has an updated concept-level template that presents each concept and exemplar in the same manner:<br>Each <strong>CONCEPT</strong> follows the following template: <br>Normal Presentation - Developmental Considerations - Alterations - Related Concepts - Physical Assessment - Diagnostic Tests - Interventions &amp; Therapies<br>Each <strong>EXEMPLAR </strong>follows the following template: <br>Overview - Pathophysiology and Etiology - Clinical Manifestations and Therapies - Nursing Process - Nursing Care Plan&nbsp; - Relate and Reflect <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p><strong>Teaching and Learning Experience</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p></p> <p>This concept-based, student-centered text will help nurses master the essential biophysical concepts of nursing, and apply critical thinking to deepen and extend this knowledge throughout their nursing careers.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Concept-based approach helps students synthesize today's most important nursing concepts, and extend their knowledge as new evidence and standards of practice arise: </strong>Replaces rote memorization with a deeper understanding of the most crucial concepts, supported with exceptionally relevant and useful examples, and the critical thinking skills needed to extend them </li> <li> <strong>Up-to-date, thorough coverage of the 21 most crucial biophysical concepts every nurse should understand</strong>: Shows how core concepts recur throughout multiple body systems and alterations, providing a foundation for students to extend their learning throughout their careers </li> <li> <strong>Multiple pedagogical features to promote more effective learning: </strong>State-of-the-art teaching features make key concepts more accessible and intuitively understandable</li> <li> <strong>NEW!</strong> The cover of the textbook no longer references North Carolina which reflects the more nationally-focused approach in the second edition</li> <li> <strong>NEW!</strong> More equal distribution of content between volumes 1 and 2 so that there is no longer such a significant difference in the sizes of each volume.

She is also a groundbreaking author and playwright. Combining an idiosyncratic mix of autobiographical and fictional narrative with a host of philosophical and poetic observations, Cixous's writing matches the kaleidoscopic nature of her thought, offering new ways of conceptualizing sex, relationships, identity, and the self, among other topics.<br><br>Yet, as Jacques Derrida once observed, a "profound misunderstanding" hangs over the accomplishments of Cixous, with many believing the intellectual excelled only at theoretical exploration. Providing a truly liberal selection of her writings from throughout her career, Marta Segarra rediscovers Cixous's acts of invention for a new generation to enjoy. Divided into thematic concerns, these works fully capture Cixous's genius for merging fiction, theory, and the experience of living. They discuss dreaming in the feminine, Algeria and Germany, love and the other, the animal, Derrida, and the theater. They defy classification, locking literature, philosophy, and psychoanalysis into thrilling new patterns of engagement. Whether readers are familiar with Cixous or are approaching her thought for the first time, all will find fresh perspectives on gender, fiction, drama, philosophy, religion, and the postcolonial.</p><p><p>The essential companion to a brilliant iconoclast's lifework.</p>Marta Segarra is professor of French studies and feminist theory and director of the Center for Women and Literature at the University of Barcelona.

Now, in this new biography, Martin Kemp explores the essential nature of this forever fascinating artist-engineer, both as an individual and as a historical phenomenon. <br> How can we best understand Leonardo? How did his mind work--was he prolific but scattered in his thinking, or is there a method in what often seems to be his madness? Was he basically an artist who also pursued science and technology, or was "science"--his understanding of the physical world--central to his artistic vision? In <em>Leonardo</em>, Martin Kemp offers a vivid portrait of the Renaissance giant that answers these questions and more. The book takes us on an absorbing journey through the life and work of Leonardo, looking first at the historical man, portraying an impressive and cultivated figure, an artist who in truth completed few paintings, rarely satisfied a commission, and yet lived in style and ended his career with a massive salary. More important, the author examines the ideas underlying Leonardo's investigations of nature, illuminating his vision of the artist-engineer as matching nature itself in his creativity. Kemp argues that Leonardo's apparent diversities reveal a desire to find an inner unity in the functioning of everything in the observable world. For Leonardo, writes Kemp, every act of looking and drawing was an act of analysis, and he used these analyses to re-make and re-interpret his surroundings. In a final chapter, Kemp also comments on the <em>Da Vinci Code</em> and "the continuing public appetite for Leonardo and his doings."<br> Beautifully illustrated with a unique "thumbnail museum" that offers a tour of all Leonardo's paintings, plus 30 additional illustrations and life-size reproductions of pages from his famous notebooks, <em>Leonardo</em> is a powerful portrait of one of the towering geniuses of world history.</p><p><br><strong>Martin Kemp</strong> is University Professor of the History of Art at the University of Oxford, Trinity College. The author of <em>The Oxford History of Western Art</em>, he is an eminent art historian who has carried out extensive research into the art, science, and technology of Leonardo.<br><br>"A serious book filled with fresh thought.... Kemp has succeeded at something that is possible only after years of reflection."--A. Richard Turner, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"Leonardo seen from the inside out.... A series of intense, learned meditations on Leonardesque themes.... Kemp tries to define what Leonardo thought he was doing, and why. He argues, convincingly, that Leonardo was constantly searching for a universal system of proportion--not merely a system of aesthetic proportion, like the famous Golden Mean, but a system of proportion that would explain, as Newton's inverse-square rule of gravity did, two centuries later, the fundamental workings of forces."--Adam Gopnick, <em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"A leading authority on Leonardo da Vinci, Kemp attempts to set forth a succinct, understandable, unified account of da Vinci's creative and intellectual life.... Fascinating, enlightening, well written, and easy to read."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Excites the reader's admiration for the restless vitality of the man and his ideas.... Kemp is at his best when elucidating Leonardo's scientific investigations.... The heart of his book introduces us to some of the investigations that kept Leonardo from finishing paintings, ranging from optics, anatomy and engineering to geology and hydraulics."--<em>Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"Kemp, an eminent Oxford art historian and Leonardo scholar, has condensed what he calls Leonardo's 'strange career' as an artist, engineer, and musician into a series of key moments."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"A noble attempt to bring a legend down to earth.... Kemp's experience offers just as many pleasures and benefits; after a career spent researching the artist, he's well suited to provide a personal account of Leonardo, enriched by anecdotes and contemporary analogies. At the close, he succinctly reviews why Leonardo is worth studying, using the <em>Mona Lisa</em> as case in point and giving a marvelous description of the experience of seeing the painting out of its frame and bullet-proof case. It makes an exceptional finale."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"If Martin Kemp's book is as widely read and discussed as it deserves to be, a new image of Leonardo will supplant that of the indecisive polymath. This new Leonardo will be seen as a consummate quester, one whose curiosity took him everywhere."--<em>St. Petersburg Times</em><p></p><br>"Kemp is a recognized authority on Leonardo and has some more substantial things to say about him. The illustrations, the thumbnail gallery of the paintings and the biographical timeline also make this a concise and useful reference book."--<em>San Jose Mercury News</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Della Robbia: Sculpting with Color in Renaissance Florence</h2><p><p><strong>The brightly hued and technically sophisticated ceramics of a Renaissance master and his workshop</strong></p><p>The glazed terra-cotta technique invented by Luca della Robbia, along with his exceptional skill as a sculptor, placed him firmly in the first rank of Renaissance artists in the fifteenth century. The Della Robbia studio produced dazzling multicolored ornaments for major Florentine buildings, delicately modeled and ingeniously constructed freestanding statues, serene blue-and-white devotional reliefs for domestic use, charming portraits of children and commanding busts of rulers, along with decorative and liturgical objects. Important patrons from the Medici family to the French court enhanced the reputation of the Della Robbia style and technique, which in turn inspired imitation by rival artists.</p><p>In recent years, renewed attention from art historians, backed by sophisticated technical studies, has reintegrated Della Robbia into the mainstream of Renaissance art history and illuminated the originality and accomplishments of the family&#x2019;s studio, which operated into the 16th century. This beautifully illustrated companion to the first major Della Robbia exhibition in the United States brings readers into the workshops of these ingenious artists to experience one of the great inventions of the Renaissance.</p><p><strong>Luca della Robbia</strong>'s (1400&#x2013;82) invention of an innovative technique for creating glazed terra-cotta sculptures was a major scientific and artistic discovery of the Italian Renaissance. Passed down to family members and developed further by each generation, the closely held technique achieved new heights of refinement and durability in modeling and color, and was praised for combining elements of painting and sculpture into a new and (in Vasari&#x2019;s words) &#x201c;almost eternal&#x201d; medium.</p></p><p>Transcendently beautiful throughout.

Or that "having an axe to grind" originated in a story told by Benjamin Franklin? These and many other idioms are explained and put into context in the delightful third edition of the <em>Oxford Dictionary of English Idioms.</em><br> In this book, John Ayto offers a fresh look at the idiomatic phrases and sayings that make English the rich language that it is. The third edition contains entries for over 6,000 idioms, including 700 entirely new entries, based on Oxford's language monitoring and the ongoing third edition of the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>. These include a range of recently established idioms such as "the elephant in the corner," "go figure," "step up to the plate," "a walk in the park," and "win ugly." Some entries simply define the expression and offer examples from literature or journalism, but other entries include notes on the origin of the phrase. Thus we learn that "there's no accounting for tastes" is a direct translation of a Latin saying, that "amok" (in the expression "run amok") comes from the Malay word <em>amuk</em>, meaning "in a homicidal frenzy," and that "damn with faint praise" comes from Alexander Pope's poem "Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot." The book also lists national variants, so that we learn that while in America they say "all over the map," in Britain they say "all over the shop." This edition also features a greatly increased number of cross-references, making it ideal for quick reference. <br> Anyone interested in the colorful side of the English language will get hours of fun browsing through this fascinating and informative volume.</p><p><br><strong>John Ayto</strong> is an experienced lexicographer and author of many language titles, including <em>The Oxford Essential Guide to the English Language</em>, <em>The Longman Register of New Words</em>, the <em>Bloomsbury Dictionary of Word Origins</em>, <em>Twentieth Century Words</em>, and <em>Wobbly Bits and Other Euphemisms</em>.

They believe most financial accounting textbooks fail to demonstrate that accounting is an exciting field of study and one that is important to future careers in business. When writing this text, they considered <strong><em>career relevance</em></strong> as their guide when selecting material, and the need to <strong><em>engage the student</em></strong> as their guide to style, pedagogy, and design.<p> <strong>Libby/Libby/Hodge</strong> successfully implements a real-world, single <strong>focus company approach in every chapter</strong>. Students and instructors have responded very favorably to the use of focus companies and the real-world financial statements. The companies chosen are engaging and the decision-making focus shows the relevance of financial accounting regardless of whether or not the student has chosen to major in accounting. </p><p> <strong>Libby/Libby/Hodge</strong> believes in the <strong>building-block approach to teaching transaction analysis</strong>. Most faculty agree that mastery of the accounting cycle is critical to success in financial accounting. And yet all other financial books introduce and develop transaction analysis in one chapter, bombarding a student early in the course with an overload of new concepts and terms. The authors believe that most faculty take more time with the accounting cycle, but other financial accounting textbooks don't. By slowing down the introduction of transactions and giving students time to practice and gain mastery, this building-block approach leads to greater student success in their study of later topics in financial accounting such as adjusting entries.</p></p><p>Patricia Libby is chair of the department of accounting and an associate professor of accounting at Ithaca College, where she teaches the undergraduate financial accounting course.

This cycle is at the root of all addictions, addictions to drugs, sex, love, cigarettes, soap operas, wealth, and wisdom itself. But why should this be so? Why are we desperate for what we don't have, or can't have, often at great cost to what we do have, thereby risking our peace and contentment, our safety, and even our lives?"<br><br>The answer, says Dr. Marc Lewis, lies in the structure and function of the human brain. <br><br>Marc Lewis is a distinguished neuroscientist. And, for many years, he was a drug addict himself, dependent on a series of dangerous substances, from LSD to heroin. His narrative moves back and forth between the often dark, compellingly recounted story of his relationship with drugs and a revelatory analysis of what was going on in his brain. <br><br>He shows how drugs speak to the brain - which is designed to seek rewards and soothe pain - in its own language. He shows in detail the neural mechanics of a variety of powerful drugs and of the onset of addiction, itself a distortion of normal perception.<br><br>Dr. Lewis freed himself from addiction and ended up studying it. At the age of 30 he traded in his pharmaceutical supplies for the life of a graduate student, eventually becoming a professor of developmental psychology, and then of neuroscience - his field for the last 12 years. This is the story of his journey, seen from the inside out.</p><p>DR. MARC LEWIS is a developmental neuroscientist and professor of human developmental psychology, recently at the University of Toronto, where he taught and conducted research from 1989 to 2010, and currently at Radboud University in the Netherlands. He is the author of over 50 journal publications in neuroscience and developmental psychology.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Lewis co-edited <b>Emotion, Development, and Self-Organization: Dynamic Systems Approaches to Emotional Development</b> (Cambridge University Press, 2000) and co-authored with his wife Isabela Granic <b>Bed Timing</b> (HarperCollins, 2009) which applies developmental theory to help parents get their young children to sleep through the night.The first time I got drunk was with Whitney Talcott. It was a March night and freezing cold. I had been at Tabor less than six months, and depression was now a palpable daily companion, a disease to be managed. There were good days and bad days, but the good days were just tolerable and the bad days nearly did me in. I hated this school. It was bigger than me, it was stronger than me, and it seemed as natural a part of the New England landscape as the rocky coves and stands of maple. I didn&#x2019;t belong here. I had got here by mistake. My first two years of high school had been at a nice, normal suburban Toronto school a few blocks from my home. I might not have been the most popular kid in class, but nobody seemed to actively dislike me. I had a few friends. I got invited to a few parties. I had a girlfriend for a couple of months. And I could go home at night. That was the main thing. Here at Tabor, there was no home to return to at the end of the day&#x2014;except the dorm. And I hated the dorm. I hated every whitewashed board, every hissing radiator, every creak in the polished hardwood floors. I hated my room, I hated my roommate. I hated the guy next door. And I hated my proctors, the senior boys whose job it was to supervise us and care for us while helping induct us into this bizarre paramilitary culture.<br>&nbsp;<br>Para-naval, actually. Tabor was a para-naval academy, but that didn&#x2019;t mean much to me at the time. The naval terminology seemed a bad joke, an effort to reenact the Hollywood heroism of World War II. We would sometimes see men who looked like admirals strolling the pathways with the headmaster. Gold stripes on dark blue cuffs. There were special prayers at vespers, navy uniforms to be ironed and worn a few weeks a year, drill sessions with guns and a marching band. And yes, we were located on a body of water and there were a lot of boats: sailboats, rowboats, crew boats, a schooner out in the harbour. It was the boats that had attracted me in the first place, the previous spring in Toronto.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Marc, we&#x2019;d like to talk to you about your options for next year,&#x201d; my mother had said in her frank, slightly invasive tone.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What options?&#x201d; I was beckoned to the kitchen table, where I sat down with both parents. The table was covered with pamphlets from different private schools, most of them in New England. &#x201c;You seem a little bored with school,&#x201d; Mom continued. &#x201c;And maybe a bit discontent overall?&#x201d; Those penetrating eyes&#x2014;hazel and clear with mildly arched brows&#x2014;scanned me for an accuracy reading. They gazed at me steadily from her pretty, mid-thirtyish face&#x2014;a face surrounded by sprayed-in-place hair that became increasingly blonde as the sixties wore on. My mother seemed to wield her own sixth sense. She could look into me and find things. As usual, I soon felt I must be hiding whatever it was she was looking for.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Mom. Everything&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d; My dad sat beside her, hunched over and uncomfortable. His pleasant features, thin black hair, and solemn brown eyes would have been more at home at a meeting of the family-run leather business. Dad didn&#x2019;t usually get involved in family discussions with an emotional theme, if that&#x2019;s what this was. Maybe he was in the dark as much as I was. His half-smile tried to make light of things. But this was sounding ominous.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know everything&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But remember we talked about boarding schools? And you said you might be interested?<br>&nbsp;<br>Remember, we&#x2019;ll be moving to San Francisco in two years&#x2019; time. Going to an American school would save you a year of high school. You&#x2019;d be able to go straight to college the year we arrive. So . . .&#x201d; she smiled encouragingly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve done my homework and gotten these pamphlets from some very fine schools. And we thought,&#x201d; with a glance at my dad, &#x201c;that you might want to look at them.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It all seemed exciting, though too far off to think about. So I looked at the pamphlets piled up in front of me. We looked together, and my parents pointed out this and that feature of this and that school. I tried to pay attention, but my thoughts wandered like stray cats. I was preoccupied&#x2014;some sort of creeping disorientation at the very prospect of leaving home. And beneath that, intangible but potent, a sense of dread. Were they trying to get rid of me? Had I done something wrong?<br>&nbsp;<br>Now Tabor was my world: there was nothing left to decide. Every morning I joined four hundred other teenage boys tramping along a wooden walkway between brick buildings in a cold mist, breakfast settling, the assembly hall looming, thinking about ways to avoid attention. Our headmaster, Mr. Witherstein, looked as though he&#x2019;d stepped out of an old movie. He parted his hair almost dead centre, and he was grey and crusty like a venerable admiral himself. He waited for us at the lectern, beaming with unnatural enthusiasm. He delighted in the series of routine announcements that he would soon recite with such gravity. I took my assigned seat. Each seat back held a short wire rack containing a hymnal. I reached toward mine automatically, on cue. We opened our hymnals together, the rustle of pages filling the hall, and we began to sing.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>A mighty fortress is our God! A bulwark never failing. </i>God had never appeared to me as a fort or a bulwark. Maybe that was because I was Jewish. Yet I didn&#x2019;t mind the singing. It numbed me. There was a comforting anonymity in being a part of this mass, this sea of boys packed row after row in a heated auditorium. I was safe for now. Back at my dorm, it was survival of the fittest, and I wasn&#x2019;t all that fit. A pecking order had consolidated in the early months, and I was pretty close to the bottom. At first my roommate, Todd, was the victim of some pretty vicious teasing by just about everyone, but especially Bill Reed, the handsome giant who lived in the room next door. Reed was a front-line football player, though still a junior, and for that alone he was universally admired. Todd put some sort of lotion on his face at night, giving it an awful vampiric whiteness, all the more disturbing with his black stubble poking through. He was soon known to one and all as Madame Butterfly. I was sympathetic at first, but I didn&#x2019;t like him much. He was caustic, whiny, and sour. I tried to like him. I tried to be nice to him. But I secretly hoped that his victimization would keep me safe, give me some breathing space.<br>&nbsp;<br>Meanwhile, Reed had risen rapidly to power. His own roommate, Randy, was an absurd-looking, gangly outcast, with protruding ears, perfectly designed by nature for the role of village idiot. And he was Reed&#x2019;s roommate! I felt sorry for Randy. What torments must he suffer? But I was relieved that Reed was surrounded by victim material. Although I knew that was selfish, I needed it to be so. I needed the playing field tilted in my favour.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, to my horror, it tilted the other way. The dominance hierarchy heaved a final time and Randy and Todd ended up Reed&#x2019;s lieutenants, his slaves. Randy brought him anything he asked for. He literally stood around, waiting for orders. Todd found his niche fawning over Reed from the sidelines, grinning at his savage jokes and heaping ridicule on his victims.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was next in line.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey Lewis!&#x201d; Reed smiled at me almost warmly from the doorway connecting our rooms. His broad, manly features beamed with good humour.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come on in. Join the party.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t refuse.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Did you see what happened to my dresser?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Take a look.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come closer.&#x201d; He seemed so inviting. I wanted to believe that I was really being included. But I didn&#x2019;t see anything unusual.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Closer!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Bring your head right up to the edge here, ya dummy. You have to look at it from just the right angle.&#x201d; I did as I was told, moving my face to within inches of the dresser surface. There seemed to be a pool of water there.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I see some water. How did that happen?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then smash! His palm came down hard on the little puddle; my face was soaked. And whatever was running down my cheeks stung my eyes, which started instantly to tear. Aftershave? Hydrochloric acid? Liquid shame? My tears were the worst part.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How did that happen?&#x201d; Reed echoed in mincing tones. &#x201c;How did that happen?&#x201d; His voice rose with incredulity while he danced around the room. &#x201c;Did it make you cry, Lewis? Poor baby, we&#x2019;d better call your Mama,&#x201d; and they all erupted into laughter, Reed, Randy, Todd, and another guy. I looked through tears at Reed&#x2019;s grinning hyena mask, curling now with contempt, and I wanted to slip through the floor. <i>What was wrong with me?!</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>I began to avoid my dorm whenever I could, to synchronize my comings and goings with those of the other boys, so Reed couldn&#x2019;t get me alone. I made a couple of friends and that helped. There were other misfits who had no interest&#x2014;and generally no place&#x2014;in the jock-dominated hierarchy. By Christmas I spent a lot of time with Schwartz and Burton. Joe Schwartz was a junior like me, but he was leather-tough in some unique way. Self-sufficient and really smart. Burton was just a big teddy bear, gruff and mischievous, whom nobody could dislike. I got to know their friends, Gelsthorpe, Perry, and Norris, all seniors. These were the guys who would graduate at the end of the year, and they all lived in another dorm, Pond House. I spent a lot of time at Pond House, and I wished I could switch. But at night I had to return to my own dorm, with its sixteen boys, often creeping up the back stairs to avoid notice. Sometimes, before going to my room and facing Todd, I&#x2019;d drop in on Lawrence Carr, one of the two black kids at Tabor. That&#x2019;s two out of four hundred. The other one, Lavalle, was despised by all: he wore his bitterness like an armband. But Carr stayed above the fray and was left alone. In my eyes he was magnificent.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How do you handle it?&#x201d; I wanted to know.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I take it all for granted,&#x201d; he replied. His smile was gentle, chiding.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What did you expect, man? Tabor is no temple of brotherhood. It is exactly what it appears to be.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Just wait it out. Keep your own council.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It seemed easy for him.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I finally learned how to avoid Reed&#x2019;s displays of goodwill, trouble came from a guy named Roche who lived across the hall. Passing his door became an agony of nerves.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A Jew! A Jew! Excuse me! I mean ah-choo! Bless me! Hey Lewis, did you hear someone sneeze?&#x201d; His voice rang with feigned bafflement.<br>&nbsp;<br>Roche was rotund and greasy, with small eyes and a blistering tongue. He sat chinless, unmoving, on a chair well inside his room, opposite the door, waiting for fresh bait to pass within range without his having to move from his lair. I was bait. Defenceless bait.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let them know they&#x2019;re getting you down,&#x201d; my mother advised on the phone. &#x201c;If they don&#x2019;t get a reaction, they&#x2019;ll stop.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>That was probably the worst advice I&#x2019;d ever got from anyone. Or maybe I just didn&#x2019;t know how to implement it. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine how I might pretend that it wasn&#x2019;t getting me down. It crushed me! Roche could see my face as I hurried by or see me looking down, avoiding his gaze.<br>&nbsp;<br>But I soon got more potent advice from an unlikely source, a boy named Miles. He was a loner like Carr, and confident like Carr&#x2014;in fact contemptuous of the scurrying cruelty around him. I sat at the foot of his bed one night, looking at unfathomable pictures of his enormous home in the Deep South.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lewis,&#x201d; he asked, leaning regally against the headboard, &#x201c;why do you let Roche pick on you?&#x201d; He studied me carefully, trying to discern the peculiar defect that must be there.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t . . . mean to. What choice do I have?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What choice?&#x201d; He snorted with mild disgust. &#x201c;Lewis, your problem is that you have no common sense. You&#x2019;re an intelligent kid, but you don&#x2019;t know how to use it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What should I do?&#x201d; If there was some workable trick, I wanted badly to know it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Look at Roche. Does he have any weaknesses?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, no. He&#x2019;s got lots of friends in fact.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, but is there anything about him that&#x2019;s . . . that he&#x2019;s not proud of? That he doesn&#x2019;t want his friends to see?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Just that he&#x2019;s fat, I guess.&#x201d;</p><h2>Life&#39;s Little Ironies (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The phrase "life's little ironies" is now proverbial, but it was coined by Hardy as the title for this, his third volume of short stories, including such classics as <em>An Imaginative Woman</em> and <em>A Tragedy of Two Ambitions</em>. Unified by his quintessential irony, strong visual sense, and engaging characters, these stories deal with the tragic and the humorous, the metaphysical and the magical. This edition is the first to be based on a critical examination of all available manuscript and printed versions of the texts.</p><p>Alan Manford is Head of English at Holy Trinity School Birmingham. Norman Page, who wrote the introduction is Professor Emeritus of Modern English Literature at the University of Nottingham.</p><h2>The End of Kings: A History of Republics and Republicans</h2><p><p>Written in clear, lively prose, <i>The End of Kings</i> traces the history of republican governments and the key figures that are united by the simple republican maxim: <i>No man shall rule alone.</i> Breathtaking in its scope, Everdell's book moves from the Hebrew Bible, Solon's Athens and Brutus's Rome to the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson and the Watergate proceedings during which Nixon resigned. Along the way, he carefully builds a definition of "republic" which distinguishes democratic republics from aristocratic ones for both history and political science. In a new foreword, Everdell addresses the impeachment trial of President Clinton and argues that impeachment was never meant to punish private crimes. Ultimately, Everdell's brilliant analysis helps us understand how examining the past can shed light on the present.<br> <br> "[An] energetic, aphoristic, wide-ranging book."&#x2014;Marcus Cunliffe, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br> <br> "Ambitious in conception and presented in a clear and sprightly prose. . . . [This] excellent study . . . is the best statement of the republican faith since Alphonse Aulard's essays almost a century ago." &#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br> <br> "A book which ought to be in the hand of every American who agrees with Benjamin Franklin that the Founding Fathers gave us a Republic and hoped that we would be able to keep it."-Sam J. Ervin, Jr.<br> <br></p></p><p></p><h2>To Keep the Ball Rolling: The Memoirs of Anthony Powell</h2><p>To earn the reputation of a literary giant within the generation of Waugh, Orwell, and Greene is no mean feat. To do so with the grace and genius that characterized Anthony Powell&#x2014;whose twelve-volume <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i> is possibly the only English-language work to match the majestic scope of Proust's <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>&#x2014;is nothing short of spectacular. Yet Powell himself remains absent from his writing; he was, said the <i>New York Times</i>, "a writer of mordant succinctness who rewards the reader while revealing little of himself."<br><br>Powell did eventually reveal himself in four volumes of memoirs, published between 1976 and 1982. This edition of Anthony Powell's <i>Memoirs</i> is an abridged and revised version of those volumes, a version that has never before been published in this form in the United States. The result is not only a fascinating view of Powell as a man and an author but also a unique history of British literary society and the social elite Powell lampooned and moved within from the twenties through the eighties. From Eton and Oxford to his life as a novelist and critic, Powell observes all&#x2014;the obscenity trial sparked by <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>; Shirley Temple's libel suit after Graham Greene reviewed <i>Wee Willie Winkie</i> "with even more than his usual verve"&#x2014;and paints vivid portraits of Kingsley Amis, V.S. Naipaul, T.S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and countless others. Most importantly, Powell's lively memoirs banish all thought of the man as a relic of the British gentry. He was a modernist, a Tory, and more than a little interested in genealogy and peerage, but a man who, according to Ferdinand Mount, "miraculously knew what life was like."</p><p><b>Anthony Powell</b> (1905-2000) was born in London and educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. He worked for a London publisher from 1927 to 1935 and as a film scriptwriter from 1935 to 1936. He also served as a liaison officer for the Intelligence Corps during World War II. The literary editor of <i>Punch</i> from 1952 to 1958, Powell also wrote reviews and literary columns for many newspapers and periodicals. He became an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1997 and was named a Commander of the British Empire in 1956 and, after refusing a knighthood in 1973, a Companion of Honor in 1988. His published works include <i>Afternoon Men</i> (1931), <i>From a View to a Death</i> (1933), <i>What's Become of Waring</i> (1939), and his twelve-volume masterpiece <i>A Dance to the Music of Time</i>, the latter available from the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;Among portraits of twentieth-century British literary life this is perhaps the wittiest and most keenly observed&#x2014;and certainly the finest written.&#x201d; (<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Powell can offer many of the rewards of comic creation we find in a Dickens or a Jane Austen, coupled with the ultimate gift of such creations.&#x201d; (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)</p><h2>Developing Helping Skills: A Step-by-Step Approach (with DVD)</h2><p>Build your fundamental helping skills, and more important, the ability to transfer those skills to actual real-world situations with the unique approach found in Chang/Scott/Decker&#39;s DEVELOPING HELPING SKILLS: A STEP BY STEP APPROACH.

This is a unique and authoritative reference book for the research student and the general reader. The A-Z format, extensive cross-referencing, chronologies, illustrations, and maps, both facilitate quick reference and encourage further exploration. Entries are also designed to explore scholarly trends and to reflect contemporary directions in literary study. They offer insight into publishing history, biographical studies, collectors and museums, book illustration, and theoretical and critical approaches to the Bront�s' writings. This <em>Companion</em> is not only invaluable for quick searches, but a delight to browse, and an inspiration to further reading.</p><p><br><strong>Christine Alexander</strong> is Professor of English at the University of New South Wales. Her books include the multi-volume <em>Edition of the Early Writings of Charlotte Bront�</em> (1987-91), <em>The Art of the Bront�s</em> (1995), and the British-academy prize-winning book <em>The Early Writings of Charlotte Bront�</em> (1982). She has also published widely on gothic literature, Jane Austen, critical editing, literary juvenilia, and landscape gardening. <strong>Margaret Smith</strong> is Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Research in Arts and Social Sciences, University of Birmingham. She has edited many of the Bront�s' works, including <em>The Professor</em>, <em>Jane Eyre</em>, <em>Shirley</em>, <em>Villette</em>, and <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em>, and the Bront� letters.<br>For almost two centuries both general readers and scholars have been intrigued by the writings that sprang from the fertile imaginations of a curate's children raised on the moors of Yorkshire. Covering not only the three Bronte sisters who have attracted the most attention (Anne, Charlotte, and Emily) but also their brother, Branwell, and their father, Patrick, this guide provides a wealth of information about their lives and works and the society in which they lived, as well as historical and critical perspectives on their writings. The more than 1,000 alphabetically arranged entries include lengthy articles on each Bronte and his or her individual works and shorter entries on characters and places in the writings and real people, places, and other entities associated with them. In addition, numerous substantive thematic and topical entries (for example, <i>Art of the Brontes, Health and medicine, Psychoanalytic approaches</i>) help to elucidate the Brontes' world and their creative output. Bibliographical references generally accompany longer entries, and a selective bibliography appears at the end of the volume. The latter provides no references to relevant Internet sites, an unfortunate omission, since useful tools for studying the Brontes are available on the Web. Additional features include a generous network of cross-references, a number of black-and-white illustrations, a chronology, and a section that identifies dialect and obsolete words in the Brontes' writings. Providing an overview of the entire work is a classified index that arranges entries into topical categories, enabling users to find, for example, all entries relating to adaptations of the Brontes' works or to places where they traveled. <p>As Bronte scholars, Alexander and Smith are highly qualified to have undertaken this project, and they and the seven other contributors have created a valuable compendium of impeccable scholarship. Containing more than twice as many entries as <i>The Brontes: A to Z</i> (Facts On File, 2003), this excellent guide is the most comprehensive and scholarly reference companion to the Brontes now available. It is highly recommended for all academic libraries and larger public libraries. <i>Marie Ellis</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In its simplest definition, astrology is a language. It is the language of the universe and it has its own alphabet and rules of grammar. The planets and the personal sensitive points (collectively called &#x2018;points&#x2019;) are symbols which are impor-tant letters in astrology&#x2019;s alphabet. This work provides insight into understanding and appreciating the role of astrological symbols. <p>Midpoints express the astrological role of the points in subtle, yet powerful, ways. A mid-point is the middle or centered location of any pair of point influences. Powerful new images of these point combinations are unleashed through the definitions on these pages. This book was not written to teach you the basic rules of astrology or how to interpret a horoscope. But if you want to learn ideas beyond routine fundamentals, this book is essential. It explains basic concepts in a new way; provides insight on how to view life; and brings additional understanding about your feelings, activities, situations, reactions, relationships or behavior.</p></p><p></p><h2>Early Medieval Ireland, 400-1200 (Longman History of Ireland)</h2><p>This impressive survey covers the early history of Ireland from the coming of Christianity to the Norman settlement (400 - 1200 AD).

The years after 1500 brought the construction of several iconic Late Gothic monuments, including the transept facades of Beauvais cathedral in northern France, much of King's College in Cambridge, England, and the parish church at Annaberg in Saxony. Most designers and patrons preferred this elite Gothic style, which was considered fashionable and highly refined, to alternative Italianate styles. Ethan Matt Kavaler connects Gothic architecture to related developments in painting and other media, and considers the consequences of the breakdown of the Gothic system in the early 16th century.</p><p>Late Gothic architecture is recognized for its sensuous and abundant ornament. Its visually rich surfaces signify wealth and magnificence, and its flamboyant geometric designs portray a system of perfect and essential forms that convey spiritual authority, while often serving as signs of personal or corporate identity. <i>Renaissance Gothic</i> presents a groundbreaking and detailed study of the Gothic architecture of the late 15th and 16th centuries across Europe.</p></p><p><b>Ethan Matt Kavaler</b> is professor of art history at the University of Toronto."As to be expected of Yale and Metropolitan Museum of Art publications, this is a beautifully illustrated book that complements the tapestries that inspired the research.

The authors draw from their own complementary lives and careers to illustrate the reality, scope, and excitement of the discipline. Particularly emphasized is that archaeology is not esoteric but is rich in career opportunities; it is a science that touches all citizens as stewards of the past. High-interest topics such as famous archaeological sites and engaging controversies in archaeology will appeal to curious students. The Kehoe-Pleger module is brief enough to fit into a general introductory anthropology course and solid enough to serve as a backbone text for introductory archaeology courses.</p><p>Titles of related interest also from Waveland Press: Fagan, Quest for the Past: Great Discoveries in Archaeology, Second Edition (ISBN 9780881337914); Kamp, Life in the Pueblo: Understanding the Past through Archaeology (ISBN 9780881339642); Kehoe, The Kensington Runestone: Approaching a Research Question Holistically (ISBN 9781577663713); Lamberg-Karlovsky &amp; Sabloff, Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica, Second Edition (ISBN 9780881338348); Saraydar, Replicating the Past: The Art and Science of the Archaeological Experiment (ISBN 9781577665571); and Struever-Holton, Koster: Americans in Search of Their Prehistoric Past (ISBN 9781577661672).<p>&#x201c;There are several excellent texts like this one, but the Kehoe-Pleger version stands out because of the clear, well-thought-out composition, the careful choice of examples, and the student-oriented organization.

It will serve as the canonical volume of criticism by Hill, the pre-eminent poet-critic whom A. N. Wilson has called "probably the best writer alive, in verse or in prose." In his criticism Hill ranges widely, investigating both poets (including Jonson, Dryden, Hopkins, Whitman, Eliot, and Yeats ) and prose writers (such as Tyndale, Clarendon, Hobbes, Burton, Emerson, and F. H. Bradley). He is also steeped in the historical context - political, poetic, and religious - of the writers he studies. Most importantly, he brings texts and contexts into new and telling relations, neither reducing texts to the circumstances of their utterance nor imagining that they can float free of them. A number of the essays have already established themselves as essential reading on particular subjects, such as his analysis of Vaughan's "The Night", his discussion of Gurney's poetry, and his critical account of <em>The Oxford English Dictionary</em>. Others confront the problems of language and the nature of value directly, as in "Our Word is Our Bond", "Language, Suffering, and Value", and "Poetry and Value". In all his criticism, Hill reveals literature to be an essential arena of civic intelligence.</p><p><br>Born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire in 1932, Geoffrey Hill is the author of a dozen books of poetry.

Feynman</b> was born in 1918 in Brooklyn and received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1942. Despite his youth, he played an important part in the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos during World War II. Subsequently, he taught at Cornell and at the California Institute of Technology. In 1965 he received the Nobel Prize in Physics, along with Sin-Itero Tomanaga and Julian Schwinger, for his work in quantum electrodynamics. </p><p>Dr. Feynman won his Nobel Prize for successfully resolving problems with the theory of quantum electrodynamics. He also created a mathematical theory that accounts for the phenomenon of superfluidity in liquid helium. Thereafter, with Murray Gell-Mann, he did fundamental work in the area of weak interactions such as beta decay. In later years Feynman played a key role in the development of quark theory by putting forward his parton model of high energy proton collision processes.</p><p>Beyond these achievements, Dr. Feynman introduced basic computational techniques and notations into physics, above all, the ubiquitous Feynman diagrams that, perhaps more than any other formalism in recent scientific history, have changed the way in which basic physical processes are conceptualized and calculated.</p><p>Feynman was a remarkable effective educator. Of all his numerous awards, he was especially proud of the Oersted Medal for Teaching which he won in 1972. <b><i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i></b>, originally published in 1963, were described by a reviewer in Scientific American as "tough, but nourishing and full of flavor. After 25 years it is the guide for teachers and for the best of beginning students." In order to increase the understanding of physics among the lay public, Dr. Feynman wrote <b><i>The Character of Physical Law</i></b> and <b><i>Q.E.D.: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter</i></b>. He also authored a number of advanced publications that have become classic references and textbooks for researchers and students.</p></p><h2>Introduction to Hydrology (4th Edition)</h2><p>Water management is taking on new directions.

The basic layers of argument are introduced in early chapters, with material arranged into increasingly sophisticated topics beginning with the most obvious or explicit layers (claims) and moving to more implied or &#34;hidden&#34; layers (assumptions, values, beliefs, ideology). By the time you finish Part 1, you will have a thorough understanding of argument, which you can then apply not just to the invention projects in Chapters 7?12 but also to your writing for other college courses and beyond.</p><p>John Mauk has a Ph.D. in rhetoric and writing from Bowling Green State University and a Masters in language and literature from the University of Toledo.

Based on clinical experience and evidence, this groundbreaking book represents a development of cognitive therapy through the concept of metacognition. It provides guidelines for innovative treatments of emotional disorders and goes on to offer conceptual arguments for the future development of cognitive therapy. Offers a new concept in cognitive therapy and guidelines for innovative treatment. Clinically grounded, based on a thorough understanding of cognitive therapies in practice. Written by a recognized authority and established author.</p><p>Cognitive therapies for psychological disorders are increasingly recognised as effective and client-friendly treatment approaches that are well supported by outcome and research evidence. However, there is much scope for improving our knowledge and treatment of emotional disorders. This book helps to develop an understanding of the internal rules and processes that guide thinking, and the factors that lead individuals to become trapped in cycles of negative and distorted thought. <p>In a ground-breaking new approach to cognitive therapy, Adrian Wells addresses limitations of cognitive theories and describes how metacognition, self-attentional processes, and worry/rumination strategies are central to emotional vulnerability, to the maintenance of trauma-related stress reactions, to and emotional disorders. Using the meta-cognitive model, the author describes in detail new clinical strategies which help to guide the clinician towards a fresh cognitive approach to changing negative thoughts, distorted beliefs, and distressing emotions.</p> <p>Trainee therapists and practitioners, as well as experts working at the frontiers of cognitive therapy, will welcome this book for its<br> <br> </p> <ul> <li>introduction to this innovative, powerful approach to emotional disorders</li> <li>details clinical guidelines and applications</li> <li>theoretical and research-based development of cognitive therapy</li> </ul> "Any clinician, researcher, or theoretician dealing with emotional disorders should read this book. Adrian Wells is doing some of the most creative and thoughtful work today on the nature and treatment of emotional disorders. As one of the few individuals to thoughtfully integrate emerging principles of cognitive science with the practice of cognitive therapy. Wells provides a fresh perspective on the process of change in emotional disorders that leads to innovative new treatment strategies."&#x2015;David H Barlow, PhD, Center for Anxiety and Related Disroders at Boston University, USA<p><strong>Adrian Wells</strong>, University of Manchester, UK.</p></p><h2>History of Madness</h2><p><p>When it was first published in France in 1961 as <em>Folie et D�raison: Histoire de la Folie � l'�ge Classique</em>, few had heard of a thirty-four year old philosopher by the name of Michel Foucault. By the time an abridged English edition was published in 1967 as <em>Madness and Civilization</em>, Michel Foucault had shaken the intellectual world. </p> <p>This translation is the first English edition of the complete French texts of the first and second edition, including all prefaces and appendices, some of them unavailable in the existing French edition. </p> <p></p> <p><em>History of Madness</em> begins in the Middle Ages with vivid descriptions of the exclusion and confinement of lepers. Why, Foucault asks, when the leper houses were emptied at the end of the Middle Ages, were they turned into places of confinement for the mad? Why, within the space of several months in 1656, was one out of every hundred people in Paris confined?</p> <p></p> <p>Shifting brilliantly from Descartes and early Enlightenment thought to the founding of the H�pital G�n�ral in Paris and the work of early psychiatrists Philippe Pinel and Samuel Tuke, Foucault focuses throughout, not only on scientific and medical analyses of madness, but also on the philosophical and cultural values attached to the mad. He also urges us to recognize the creative and liberating forces that madness represents, brilliantly drawing on examples from Goya, Nietzsche, Van Gogh and Artaud.</p> <p></p> <p>The <em>History of Madness</em> is an inspiring and classic work that challenges us to understand madness, reason and power and the forces that shape them. </p></p><p><p><strong>Michel Foucault</strong> (1926-84).

He lives in New Mexico.</p>Introduction<br><br>In introducing this anthology of American scientific writing I invoke two <br>recently dead heroes, one a scientist and American, the other a writer, not <br>trained in science and not from America but a lover of both. Carl Sagan gave <br>one of his last books the characteristically memorable subtitle Science as a <br>Candle in the Dark. Douglas Adams chose to study English literature at <br>Cambridge, but he explained to me, in a televised conversation in 1997, that <br>his reading habits have now changed: "I think I read much more science than <br>novels. I think the role of the novel has changed a little bit. In the nineteenth <br>century the novel was where you went to get your serious reflections and <br>questionings about life. You"d go to Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Nowadays, of <br>course, you know the scientists actually tell us much, much more about <br>such issues than you would ever get from novelists. So I think for the real <br>solid red meat of what I read I go to science books, and read some novels as <br>light relief."<br> Even while listening to him, I reflected on my frustration, going into <br>bookshops and trying to find scientific books. If there is a science section at <br>all, it is dwarfed not only by fiction, history, biography, "self-help," cookery, <br>and gardening, but also by "new age," "occult," and religion. It has become a <br>commonplace that astrology books outsell astronomy by a large margin.<br> Turning back to Adams, I asked him, "What is it about science <br>that really gets your blood running?" and he replied: "The world is a thing of <br>utter inordinate complexity and richness and strange- ness that is absolutely <br>awesome. I mean, the idea that such complexity can arise not only out of <br>such simplicity but probably absolutely out of nothing is the most fabulous, <br>extraordinary idea. And once you get some kind of inkling of how that might <br>have happened &#x2014; it"s just wonderful. And I feel, you know, that the <br>opportunity to spend seventy or eighty years of your life in such a universe is <br>time well spent as far as I am concerned!"<br> Carl Sagan obviously shared those sentiments and devoted much <br>of his career to expounding them, but The Demon-Haunted World, whose <br>subtitle I quoted, has a darker theme. The darkness of ignorance breeds fear. <br>In the words of a prayer which I early learned from my Cornish grandmother,<br><br>From ghoulies and ghosties and long-leggety beasties And things that go <br>bump in the night Good Lord deliver us.<br><br>Some say it is Scottish, not Cornish, but the sentiments are anyway <br>worldwide. People are afraid of the dark. Science, as Sagan argued and <br>personally exemplifled, has the power to reduce ignorance and dispel fear. <br>We should all read science and learn to think like scientists, not because <br>science is useful (though it is), but because the light of knowledge is <br>wonderful and banishes the debilitating and time-wasting fear of the dark. <br>That uncompromisingly articulate chemist Peter Atkins has a utopian vision <br>of a scientifically enlightened world which I share: "When we have dealt with <br>the values of the fundamental constants by seeing that they are unavoidably <br>so, and have dismissed them as irrelevant, we shall have arrived at complete <br>understanding. Fundamental science can then rest. We are almost there. <br>Complete knowledge is within our grasp. Comprehension is moving across <br>the face of the Earth, like the sunrise."<br> Unfortunately, science arouses fears of its own, usually because <br>of a confusion with technology. Even technology is not inherently frightening, <br>but it can, of course, do bad things as well as good. If you want to do good, <br>or if you want to do bad, science will provide the most effective way in either <br>case. The trick is to choose the good rather than the bad, and what I fear is <br>the judgment of those to whom society delegates that choice.<br> Science is the systematic method by which we apprehend what is <br>true about the real world in which we live. If you want consolation, or an <br>ethical guide to the good life, you can look elsewhere (and may be <br>disappointed). But if you want to know what is true about reality, science is <br>the only way. If there were a better way, science would embrace it.<br> Science can be seen as a sophisticated extension of the sense <br>organs nature gave us. Properly used, the worldwide cooperative enterprise of <br>science works like a telescope pointing toward reality; or, turned around, a <br>microscope to dissect details and analyze causes. So understood, science <br>is fundamentally a benign force, even though the technology that it spawns is <br>powerful enough to be dangerous when abused. Ignorance of science can <br>never be a good thing, and scientists have a paramount duty to explain their <br>subject and make it as simple as possible (though no simpler, as Einstein <br>rightly insisted).<br> Ignorance is usually a passive state, seldom deliberately sought <br>or intrinsically blameworthy. Unfortunately, there do seem to be some people <br>who positively prefer ignorance and resent being told the truth. Michael <br>Shermer, debonair editor and proprietor of Skeptic magazine, tells of the <br>audience reaction when he unmasked a professional charlatan onstage. Far <br>from showing Shermer the gratitude he deserved for exposing a fake who was <br>conning them, the audience was hostile. "One woman glared at me and told <br>me it was "inappropriate" to destroy these people"s hopes during their time of <br>grief."<br> Admittedly, this particular phony"s claim was to communicate <br>with the dead, so the bereaved may have had special reasons for resenting a <br>scientific debunker. But Shermer"s experience is typical of a more general <br>mood of protective affection for ignorance. Far from being seen as a candle in <br>the dark, or as a wonderful source of poetic inspiration, science is too often <br>decried as poetry"s spoilsport.<br> A more snobbish denigration of science can be found in some, but <br>by no means all, literary circles. "Scientism" is as dirty a word as any in <br>today"s intellectual lexicon. Scientific explanations that have the virtue of <br>simplicity are derided as "simplistic." Obscurity is often mistaken for <br>profundity; simple clarity can be taken for arrogance. Analytical minds are <br>denigrated as "reductionist" &#x2014; as with "sin," we may not know what it means, <br>but we do know that we are against it. The Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning immunologist <br>and polymath Peter Medawar, not a man to suffer fools gladly, remarked <br>that "reductive analysis is the most successful research stratagem ever <br>devised," and continued: "Some resent the whole idea of elucidating any <br>entity or state of affairs that would otherwise have continued to languish in a <br>familiar and nonthreatening squalor of incomprehension."<br> Nonscientific ways of thinking &#x2014; intuitive, sensitive, imaginative <br>(as if science were not imaginative!) &#x2014; are thought by some to have a built-in <br>superiority over cold, austere, scientific "reason." Here"s Medawar again, this <br>time in his celebrated lecture "Science and Literature": "The official Romantic <br>view is that Reason and the Imagination are antithetical, or at best that they <br>provide alternative pathways leading to the truth, the pathway of Reason <br>being long and winding and stopping short of the summit, so that while <br>Reason is breathing heavily there is Imagination capering lightly up the hill."<br> Medawar goes on to point out that this view was even once <br>supported by scientists themselves. Newton claimed to make no <br>hypotheses, and scientists generally were supposed to employ "a calculus of <br>discovery, a formulary of intellectual behaviour which could be relied upon to <br>conduct the scientist towards the truth, and this new calculus was thought of <br>almost as an antidote to the imagination."<br> Medawar"s own view, inherited from his "personal guru" Karl <br>Popper and shared by most scientists today, was that imagination is seminal <br>to all science but is tempered by critical testing against the real world. <br>Creative imagination and critical rigor are both to be found in this collection of <br>contemporary American scientific literature.<br> For a non-American to be invited by a leading American publisher <br>to anthologize American writings about science is an honor, the more so <br>because American science is, by almost any index one could conjure, <br>preeminent in the world. Whether we measure the money spent on research <br>or count the numbers of active scientists working, of books and journal <br>articles published, or of major prizes won, the United States leads the rest of <br>the world by a convincing margin. My admiration for American science is so <br>enthusiastic, so downright grateful, that I hope I may not be thought <br>presumptuous if I sound a note of discordant warning. American science <br>leads the world, but so does American anti-science. Nowhere is this more <br>clearly seen than in my own field of evolution.<br> Evolution is one of the most securely established facts in all <br>science. The knowledge that we are cousins to apes, kangaroos, and <br>bacteria is beyond all educated doubt: as certain as our (once doubted) <br>knowledge that the planets orbit the sun, and that South America was once <br>joined to Africa, and India distant from Asia. Particularly secure is the fact <br>that life"s evolution began a matter of billions of years ago. And yet, if polls <br>are to be believed, approximately 45 percent of the population of the United <br>States firmly believes, to the contrary, an elementary falsehood: all species <br>separately owe their existence to "intelligent design" less than ten thousand <br>years ago. Worse, the nature of American democratic institutions is such <br>that this perversely ignorant half of the population (which does not, I hasten to <br>add, include leading churchmen or leading scholars in any discipline) is in <br>many districts strongly placed to influence local educational policy. I have <br>met biology teachers in various states who feel physically intimidated from <br>teaching the central theorem of their subject. Even reputable publishers have <br>felt sufficiently threatened to censor school textbooks of biology.<br> That 45 percent figure really is something of a national educational <br>disgrace. You"d have to travel right past Europe to the theocratic societies <br>around the Middle East before you hit a comparable level of antiscientific <br>miseducation. It is bafflingly paradoxical that the United States is by far the <br>world"s leading scientific nation while simultaneously housing the most <br>scientifically illiterate populace outside the Third World.<br> Sputnik, the Russian satellite launched in 1957, was widely seen <br>as a salutary lesson, spurring the United States out of complacency and into <br>redoubled educational efforts in science. Those efforts paid off spectacularly, <br>for example, in the dazzling successes of the space program and the Human <br>Genome Project. But more than forty years have passed since Sputnik, and I <br>am not the only Americophile to suggest that another such fright may be <br>needed. Short of that &#x2014; well, in any case &#x2014; we need excellent scientific <br>writing for a general audience. Fortunately that high-quality commodity is in <br>abundant supply in America, which has made the compiling of this anthology <br>both easy and a pleasure. The only difficulty, indeed the only pain, has been <br>in deciding what to leave out.<br> Should a collection such as this be timely or timeless? Topical <br>and of-the-moment? Or sub specie aeternitatis? I think both. On the one <br>hand, the volume is one of a series, tied to a particular year, sandwiched <br>between predecessors and successors. That nudges us in the direction of <br>topicality: what are the hot scientific subjects of 2003; what are the current <br>political and social issues that scientific writings of the previous year might <br>illuminate? On the other hand, science"s ambitions &#x2014; more so, I venture, <br>than any other discipline"s &#x2014; approach the timeless, even the eternal. Laws <br>of nature that changed from year to year, or even from eon to eon, would <br>seem too parochial to deserve the name. Of course our understanding of <br>natural law changes &#x2014; for the better &#x2014; from decade to decade, but that is <br>another matter. And, within the unchanging laws of the universe, their <br>physical manifestations change, on time scales spanning gigayears to <br>femtoseconds.<br> Biology, like physics, anchors itself in uniformitarianism. Its <br>defining engine &#x2014; evolution &#x2014; is change, change par excellence. But <br>evolution is the same kind of change now as it was in the Cretaceous, and as <br>it will be in all futures we can imagine. The play"s the same, though the <br>players that walk the stage are different. Their costumes are similar enough <br>to connect, say, triceratops with rhinoceros, or allosaurus with tiger, in <br>ecological continuity. If an ecologist, a physiologist, a biochemist, and a <br>geneticist were to mount an expedition to the Cretaceous or the <br>Carboniferous, their 2003-vintage skills and education would serve them <br>almost as well as if they were going to, say, Madagascar today. DNA is <br>DNA, proteins are proteins. They and their interactions change only trivially. <br>The principles of Darwinian natural selection, of Mendelian and molecular <br>genetics, of physiology and ecology, the laws of island biogeography, all <br>these surely applied to dinosaurs, and before them to mammal-like reptiles, <br>just as they apply now to birds and modern mammals. They will still apply in <br>a hundred million years" time, when we are extinct and new faunistic players <br>have taken the stage. The leg muscles of a tyrannosaur in hot-breathed <br>pursuit were fueled by ATP such as any modern biochemist would recognize, <br>charged up by Krebs cycles indistinguishable from the Krebs cycles of <br>today. The science of life doesn"t change from eon to eon, even if life itself <br>does.<br> So far, so timeless. But we live in 2003. Our lives are measured in <br>decades and our psychological horizons crammed somewhere between <br>seconds and centuries, seldom reaching further. Science"s laws and <br>principles may be timeless, but science bears mightily upon our fleeting <br>selves. The science and nature writing of 2002 is not the same as it was ten <br>years ago, partly because we now know more about what is eternally true, <br>but also because the world in which we live changes, and so does science"s <br>impact upon it. Some of the essays and articles in this book are firmly date-<br>stamped; some are timeless. We need both.<br> Nature writing perennially returns to the theme of conservation and <br>extinction. Of all arguments in favor of preserving species from extinction, I <br>am moved more by aesthetic sentiment than by utilitarian advocacies of <br>the "You never know whether something in the rain forest might eventually <br>turn out to be useful to humanity" kind. But aesthetic isn"t a big enough word, <br>nor is sentiment. Douglas Adams"s Professor Chronotis used his time <br>machine for only one regular purpose: he would visit pre-seventeenth-century <br>Mauritius, weep over the dodo, and return. The sense of irreparable loss &#x2014; <br>grief &#x2014; our descendants will feel for elephants and whales brings today"s <br>imagination up short. Today we are still privileged to watch these great <br>creatures, dodos for future generations to weep over. And we are still finding <br>out new and extraordinary things about them, as "Four Ears to the Ground" <br>and "Fat Heads Sink Ships" both show.<br> My ...</p><h2>Clarinet For Dummies</h2><p><b>Master the most popular woodwind</b> <p>Want to play the clarinet?

The strongest play is the final one, THE EUMENIDES, during which Orestes is tried before Athena for the murder of his mother, Clytemnestra. It features a fine performance by Robertson Dean as Apollo, Orestes's advocate. After listening to the trilogy, it's easy to appreciate the challenges of adapting Greek dramatic conventions to audio. For example, lengthy passages are delivered by a chorus, which may seem contrived to modern listeners. Unfortunately, this production magnifies that awkwardness--far too many lines are delivered with injudicious sound effects and multiple voices that are more cloying than dramatic.

Luciano Floridi, one of the leading figures in contemporary philosophy, argues that the explosive developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is changing the answer to these fundamental human questions. <br><br>As the boundaries between life online and offline break down, and we become seamlessly connected to each other and surrounded by smart, responsive objects, we are all becoming integrated into an "infosphere". Personas we adopt in social media, for example, feed into our 'real' lives so that we begin to live, as Floridi puts in, "onlife". Following those led by Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud, this metaphysical shift represents nothing less than a fourth revolution. <br><br>"Onlife" defines more and more of our daily activity - the way we shop, work, learn, care for our health, entertain ourselves, conduct our relationships; the way we interact with the worlds of law, finance, and politics; even the way we conduct war. In every department of life, ICTs have become environmental forces which are creating and transforming our realities. How can we ensure that we shall reap their benefits? What are the implicit risks? Are our technologies going to enable and empower us, or constrain us? Floridi argues that we must expand our ecological and ethical approach to cover both natural and man-made realities, putting the 'e' in an environmentalism that can deal successfully with the new challenges posed by our digital technologies and information society.<br></p><p><br>Luciano Floridi, <em>Professor of Philosophy and Ethics of Information at the University of Oxford</em><br><br>Luciano Floridi is Professor of Philosophy and Ethics of Information at the University of Oxford and Fellow of St Cross College, University of Oxford.

Numerous applications of the principles and law are given for engineering applications that are primarily drawn from digital system design and electromagnetic interference (Electromagnetic Compatibility or EMC). Clock speeds of digital systems are increasingly in the GHz range as are frequencies used in modern analog communication systems. This increasing frequency content demands that more electrical engineers understand these fundamental electromagnetic principles and laws in order to design high speed and high frequency systems that will successfully operate.</p><p><b>A highly focused, applications-oriented approach to electromagnetics.</b> <p>Now that digital clock speeds and analog frequencies are increasingly in the GHz range, today's electrical engineers must understand the fundamental principles and laws of electromagnetics. That's why Clayton Paul's ELECTROMAGNETICS FOR ENGINEERS presents a focused, applications-oriented approach that will help you successfully design high-speed and high-frequency communication systems.</p> <p><b>Here's how Paul's approach works:</b></p> <p><b>1. Avoids unnecessary mathematics:</b> the text presents mathematics on a need-to-know basis, and focuses only on those derivations and vector identities that are essential to your understanding&nbsp;of the material.</p> <p><b>2. Presents many practical applications:</b> The author has carefully selected applications (along with photographs) from two areas: digital system design and electromagnetic interference, or electromagnetic compatibility.</p> <p><b>3. Emphasizes time-varying fields:</b> Reduced coverage of static (dc) fields enables you to sufficiently focus on time-varying fields, which have a large number of exciting engineering applications.</p> <p><b>4. Provides example problems and quick review exercises:</b> These pedagogical aids will help you reinforce and assess your understanding of each new concept and law.</p><b>Clayton R. Paul</b> is the author of several textbooks on electrical engineering subjects. He has also published his research in numerous technical papers, symposium proceedings, and technical reports, the majority&nbsp; of which are in his primary research area of electromagnetic compatibility of electronic systems. He is the author of the best-selling text in this field, <i>Introduction to Electromagnetic Compatibility,</i> also published by Wiley. Clayton R. Paul is the Sam Nunn Eminent Professor at Mercer University, as well as Emeritus Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Kentucky.</p><h2>Origins: The Evolution of Continents, Oceans and Life</h2><p><p>Changes in climate and sea level are nothing new - over the last 700 million years, the Earth has been slowly but constantly changing from within. We now know that our planet&#x2019;s surface, far from being fixed or stable, is composed of tectonic plates in continual movement, drifting in oceans which themselves appear and disappear over millennia. Such insecurity lies at the heart of both the physical and the living world, providing the creative impetus for all life forms to confront change, adapt and evolve.</p><p>This exceptional book celebrates the inevitability of global change and highlights our need as human beings to recognize and adjust to it. Its entertaining and accessible text displays a remarkable breadth and diversity of knowledge, drawing upon discoveries in natural history, geology, geography and paleontology to unravel secrets of millions of years. Its unique structure offers the opportunity to pursue two distinct but parallel narratives in one volume - the first characterized by discrete photo-essay spreads, and the second by authoritative running text illustrated with clearly numbered icons. Designed either to be browsed through like a website or read in chronological sequence, each chapter provides a fascinating glimpse into the formation and development of our world.</p><p>Glorious panoramic photography by the author, a specialist in interpretive landscape, reveals the physical legacy of the Earth&#x2019;s distant past. This intriguing exploration of key sites, often remote and inaccessible, provides a clear and original perspective on the Earth as a dynamic, interactive planet. The compelling narrative by a bestselling science writer places the history of our planet in a challenging contemporary context in which human beings, like all living things, must embrace change or fail to survive.</p><p>As a science writer Ron Redfern has received a number of prestigious literary and academic awards, perhaps most notably the American Institute of Professional Geologists&#x2019; Outstanding Achievement Award.

An irreverent, indulgent, and informative visual journey through the world of movie muscle, <i>Shirtless! </i>will leave you breathless.<br></p><p></p><h2>Tear Off the Masks!: Identity and Imposture in Twentieth-Century Russia</h2><p><p>When revolutions happen, they change the rules of everyday life--both the codified rules concerning the social and legal classifications of citizens and the unwritten rules about how individuals present themselves to others. This occurred in Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, which laid the foundations of the Soviet state, and again in 1991, when that state collapsed. <i>Tear Off the Masks!</i> is about the remaking of identities in these times of upheaval. Sheila Fitzpatrick here brings together in a single volume years of distinguished work on how individuals literally constructed their autobiographies, defended them under challenge, attempted to edit the "file-selves" created by bureaucratic identity documentation, and denounced others for "masking" their true social identities.</p><br><p> Marxist class-identity labels--"worker," "peasant," "intelligentsia," "bourgeois"--were of crucial importance to the Soviet state in the 1920s and 1930s, but it turned out that the determination of a person's class was much more complicated than anyone expected. This in turn left considerable scope for individual creativity and manipulation. Outright imposters, both criminal and political, also make their appearance in this book. The final chapter describes how, after decades of struggle to construct good Soviet socialist personae, Russians had to struggle to make themselves fit for the new, post-Soviet world in the 1990s--by "de-Sovietizing" themselves.</p><br><p> Engaging in style and replete with colorful detail and characters drawn from a wealth of sources, <i>Tear Off the Masks!</i> offers unique insight into the elusive forms of self-presentation, masking, and unmasking that made up Soviet citizenship and continue to resonate in the post-Soviet world.</p></p><p><p>"What makes <i>Tear off the Masks!</i> so appealing and why the pieces work so well together is that they cover a broad range of experiences associated with what it meant to be a Soviet citizen. Certainly, it will be a boon to the field to have the book available for courses. <i>Tear off the Masks!</i> is so appealingly written, full of wit and occasional humor, that it could serve as a model of the historian's craft. What we get is a phenomenal, nearly unparalleled depth of research combined with a transparency about research methods that invites the reader into this particular(ly skilled) historian's laboratory."<b>--Lewis Siegelbaum, Michigan State University, author of <i>Stalinism as a Way of Life</i></b></p><p>"<i>Tear off the Masks!</i> will be indispensable to students of Soviet history and valuable to scholars as well. Not only does it make available to the reader pioneering writings on important subjects such as defining class in the Soviet era and the institutional operations of Soviet patronage, alongside new work, but it is held together by focus on one important theme: 'the pragmatics of Soviet identity,' as it might be called. Fitzpatrick gives a vivid, sympathetic, and often entertaining picture of Soviet citizens surviving (barely) the class war (or, conversely, clawing their way up the ladder when circumstances allowed), and engaged in battles for existence of a different kind in the 1930s and 1940s."<b>--Catriona Kelly, University of Oxford, author of <i>Refining Russia</i></b></p><b>Sheila Fitzpatrick</b> is Bernadotte E. Schmitt Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago and coeditor of <i>The Journal of Modern History</i>.

Among other topics, coverage includes environmental ethics and animal rights, the limits of personal liberty, war and the struggle against terrorism, marriage and sexual morality, the death penalty, gun control, and abortion and euthanasia. The volume begins with two introductory essays written for beginning students by the editor, William H. Shaw, on the nature of morality and competing normative theories. These are followed by five other essays on ethical theory by classical and contemporary authors. The book&#39;s next 12 sections explore a wide-range of real-world ethical issues. In all, the book is composed of 53 articles (11 of which are new to this edition). To ensure that the text is as accessible as it is relevant, Shaw has edited every article with an eye toward readability, provided introductions and study questions before the essays, as well as review and discussion questions after them, and highlighted key passages to help students focus on important points and concepts.</p><p>The author and editor of numerous books and articles in the areas of ethics and social and political philosophy, William H. Shaw obtained a Ph.D. in political philosophy from the London School of Economics and teaches philosophy at San Jose State University, where he served as chair of the department for eleven years. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of Zimbabwe, the University of Hong Kong, and the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He has two other books with Cengage Learning, SOCIAL AND PERSONAL ETHICS and MORAL ISSUES IN BUSINESS (with Vincent Barry)."This is a complete text for studying Social Ethics because it has the major subjects and case studies in it.
